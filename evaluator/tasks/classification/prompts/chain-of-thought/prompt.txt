Please analyze this graph visualization using the following steps to determine its type. Consider each characteristic carefully and classify it as either: acyclic, bipartite, complete, cyclic, mesh, planar, or tree.

1. First, check if the graph contains any cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex)
2. Next, examine the connectivity pattern between vertices:
   - Are all vertices connected to all other vertices?
   - Are vertices organized in distinct sets?
   - Do vertices form a hierarchical structure?
3. Look at the edge crossings:
   - Can the graph be drawn without edge crossings?
   - Do edges form a regular pattern or grid?
4. Based on these observations, determine which category best matches the graph's structure

Provide your final classification and brief analysis in the following JSON format:

   "type_graph": "[classification]",
   "analysis": "The image shows a [classification] graph because [brief explanation based on the above analysis]."
