Generate two prompts for graph classification using a Large Vision Model.

1. Zero-shot prompt: Ask the model to classify the graph image without any prior examples or hints. The goal is to answer the question: What type of network is it?

2. Chain-of-thought prompt: Ask the model to reason step by step through the process of identifying which graph it is. The question remains: What type of network is it?

The types of graphs available to answer are:
1. acyclic
2. bipartite
3. complete
4. cyclic
5. mesh
6. planar
7. tree

Expected output format (JSON example):
```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph."
}
```
