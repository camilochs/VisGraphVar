Generate two prompts for graph reasoning using a Large Vision Model.  

1. Zero-shot prompt: Ask the model to analyze the graph image without any prior examples or hints. The goal is to answer the question: What is the shortest path in the graph? 

2. Chain-of-thought prompt: Ask the model to reason step by step through the process of identifying what a shortest path there is. The question remains: What is the shortest path in the graph?

Find the shortest path between node {start_node} and {end_node}.

Expected output format (JSON example):
```json
{
   "shortest_path": [start_node, ..., end_node],
   "analysis": "[explain]."
}
```
