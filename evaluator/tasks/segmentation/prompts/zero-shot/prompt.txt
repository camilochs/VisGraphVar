Analyze this graph visualization and identify the cut edge that, when removed, divides the graph into two separate subgraphs. A cut edge (or bridge) is a single edge whose removal increases the number of connected components.

Provide your response in the following JSON format:
```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(node1, node2)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [node1] and [node2] splits the graph into two subgraphs: [brief description of resulting subgraphs]."
}
