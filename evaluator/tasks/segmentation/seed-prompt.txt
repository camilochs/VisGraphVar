Generate two prompts for graph segmentation using a Large Vision Model.

1. Zero-shot prompt: Ask the model to analyze the graph image without any prior examples or hints. The goal is to answer the question: Which cut edge segments the graph into two subgraphs?

2. Chain-of-thought prompt: Ask the model to reason step by step through the process of identifying which cut edge it is. The question remains: Which cut edge segments the graph into two subgraphs?


Expected output format (JSON example):
```json
{
   "cut_edge": (node1, node2),
   "analysis": "[explain]."
}
```
