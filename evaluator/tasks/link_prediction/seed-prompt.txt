Generate two prompts for graph link prediction using a Large Vision Model.  

1. Zero-shot prompt: Ask the model to analyze the graph image without any prior examples or hints. The goal is to answer the question: Which two nodes should create an edge according to the graph structure?  

2. Chain-of-thought prompt: Ask the model to reason step by step through the process of identifying which nodes should be joined. The question remains: Which two nodes should create an edge according to the graph structure?

Expected output format (JSON example):
```json
{
   "nodes_prediction": [node1, node2],
   "analysis": "[explain]."
}
```
