Generate two prompts for graph pattern recognition using a Large Vision Model.  

1. Zero-shot prompt: Ask the model to analyze the graph image without any prior examples or hints. The goal is to answer the question: What kind of graph pattern do you detect and accounts are there? 

2. Chain-of-thought prompt: Ask the model to reason step by step through the process of identifying which graph pattern it is and when there are. The question remains: What kind of graph pattern do you detect and accounts are there?

The types of graphs patterns available to answer are:
1. chain
2. clique
3. star

Expected output format (JSON example):
```json
{
   "pattern": [name],
   "number_of_patterns": [number],
   "analysis": "[explain]."
}
```
