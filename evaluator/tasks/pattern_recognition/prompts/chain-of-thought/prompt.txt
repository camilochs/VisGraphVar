Carefully analyze the graph image to identify the pattern type by following these steps:

1. Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.
2. Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').
3. Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.
4. Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes.

Possible answers for pattern type include 'chain,' 'clique,' or 'star.' Please respond in the JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': [name],
   'number_of_patterns': [number],
   'analysis': '[explain].'
}
```
Where:
   - pattern is the identified pattern type.
   - number_of_patterns is the total count of this pattern type in the image.
   - analysis provides a step-by-step explanation of the graphâ€™s layout and why you identified this pattern.
