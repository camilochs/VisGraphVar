Generate two prompts for graph matching using a Large Vision Model.  

1. Zero-shot prompt: Ask the model to analyze the graph image without any prior examples or hints. The goal is to answer the question: Do these two graphs match?

2. Chain-of-thought prompt: Ask the model to reason step by step through the process of identifying whether two graphs match. . The question remains: Do these two graphs match?

The answer as to whether the two graphs coincide can be "yes" or "no".

Expected output format (JSON example):
```json
{
   "match": [answer],
   "analysis": "[explain]."
}
```
