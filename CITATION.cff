  The fast advancement of Large Vision-Language Models
  (LVLMs) has shown immense potential. These models are
  increasingly capable of tackling abstract visual tasks.
  Geometric structures, particularly graphs with their
  inherent flexibility and complexity, serve as an excellent
  benchmark for evaluating these models' predictive
  capabilities. While human observers can readily identify
  subtle visual details and perform accurate analyses, our
  investigation reveals that state-of-the-art LVLMs exhibit
  consistent limitations in specific visual graph scenarios,
  especially when confronted with stylistic variations. In
  response to these challenges, we introduce VisGraphVar
  (Visual Graph Variability), a customizable benchmark
  generator able to produce graph images for seven distinct
  task categories (detection, classification, segmentation,
  pattern recognition, link prediction, reasoning,
  matching), designed to systematically evaluate the
  strengths and limitations of individual LVLMs. We use
  VisGraphVar to produce 990 graph images and evaluate six
  LVLMs, employing two distinct prompting strategies, namely
  zero-shot and chain-of-thought. The findings demonstrate
  that variations in visual attributes of images (e.g., node
  labeling and layout) and the deliberate inclusion of
  visual imperfections, such as overlapping nodes,
  significantly affect model performance. This research
  emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive evaluation
  across graph-related tasks, extending beyond reasoning
  alone. VisGraphVar offers valuable insights to guide the
  development of more reliable and robust systems capable of
  performing advanced visual graph analysis.
