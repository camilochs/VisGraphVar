The two images are graphs representing the same network. Graph 1 consists of three nodes: 0, 1, and 2. In Graph 1, the nodes are farther apart compared to the same nodes in Graph 2.

Both graphs share the same structural relationships. Graph 1 has an edge from node 0 to 2, and the same edge exists in Graph 2. Each graph contains nodes 0, 1, and 2 with edges connecting them. The visual difference is that Graph 1 spreads these nodes across a larger space and adds additional visual information, such as ellipses (resembling physical items not present in Graph 2) and straight versus curved representations of edges. These variations in the visual design are accompanied by quantitative differences in distances and angles. Despite this, the logical or network structure (with nodes 0, 1, and 2) of the network is maintained with edges connecting nodes as logically equivalent between the two graphs.

**Analysis:** Despite the varying visual aspects, the graphs logically share the same network structure. Hence, their logical equivalence meets the matching criteria.

**Conclusion:**
