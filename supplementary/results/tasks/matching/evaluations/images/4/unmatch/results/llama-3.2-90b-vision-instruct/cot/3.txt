Graph 1 Analysis
================

### Component Analysis

*   **Node Count**: Graph 1 has multiple nodes.
*   **Node Labels**: 0, 1, and 2
*   **Edge Count**: Graph 1 has multiple edges.

Graph 2 Analysis
==================

### Component Analysis

*   **Node Count**: Graph 2 has multiple nodes.
*   **Node Labels**: 0, 1, 2, and 3
*   **Edge Count**: Graph 2 has multiple edges.

### Analysis Conclusion

**Result: "No"**

These two graphs do not match according to visual inspection, despite being topologically equivalent. Graph 1 visually positions Node 1 above Node 2 and to the left of Node 0 below it. In contrast, for Graph 2, Nodes 1 and 2 are both positioned below Node 0. Node 3 is linked to Node 2; however, Node 2 for Graph 1 does not share this connection, and it includes an additional connected to Node 0. Despite sharing the same labels, they are not represented in the same way by the graphs.

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Upon visual inspection, although Graph 1 and Graph 2 contain the same node labels, they differ significantly in the way that the nodes are linked. Graph 1 and 2 include different connections between their nodes."
