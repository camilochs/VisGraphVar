Node 1 is present in both graphs but not connected in Graph 1, whereas it is present and isolated in Graph 2.\n2. Node 3 is part of an edge in Graph 1 with Node 2, but in Graph 2, Node 3 is paired with Node 9.\n3. Node 2 is only connected to Node 3 in Graph 1, differing from Node 4 being an isolated node in Graph 2.\n4. There is no alignment in the edge structure and weights between the graphs, leading to the conclusion that they do not match."
