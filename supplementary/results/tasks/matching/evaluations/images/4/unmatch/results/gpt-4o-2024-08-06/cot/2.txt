Node count and labels match.\n\nStep 2: Examine edges in each graph. Graph 1 has a single edge between nodes 0 and 3. Graph 2 has a single edge between nodes 0 and 1. The connections do not match.\n\nStep 3: Compare any edge weights. Graph 1's edge has no visible weight. Graph 2's edge also has no visible weight. No discrepancy based on weights.\n\nFinal decision: The graphs do not match because the connectivity between nodes is different."
