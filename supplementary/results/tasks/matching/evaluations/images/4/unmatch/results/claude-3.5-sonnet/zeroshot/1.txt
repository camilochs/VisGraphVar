   "analysis": "The graphs are different in both structure and node connections. Graph 1 shows a linear arrangement of 4 nodes (labeled 3, 1, 0, 2) with 3 edges connecting them horizontally. Graph 2 shows a vertical linear arrangement of 4 nodes (labeled 0, 3, 1, 2) with 3 edges connecting them vertically. While both graphs have the same number of nodes (4) and edges (3), their spatial arrangements and connections are distinct."
