   "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels:\n- Graph 1 has 4 nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 9\n- Graph 2 has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3\n- Different node labels indicate non-matching graphs\n\n2. Edge Connections:\n- Graph 1 shows a path: 2 -> 9 -> 3\n- Graph 2 shows a path: 0 -> 1 -> 3\n- Different connection patterns\n\n3. Visual Structure:\n- Both graphs show linear paths with 3 edges\n- Graph 1 uses gray/blue edges\n- Graph 2 uses orange/yellow edges\n\n4. Conclusion:\nThe graphs do not match because they have different node labels and different connection patterns, despite having the same number of nodes and similar linear structure."
