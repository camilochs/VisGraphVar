Edge comparison:\n   - Graph 1 has one edge connecting nodes 3 and 0\n   - Graph 2 has one edge connecting nodes 1 and 0\n\n3. Decision:\n   - While both graphs have the same number of nodes with the same labels, the connections between nodes are different\n   - Graph 1 connects nodes 3-0, while Graph 2 connects nodes 1-0\n   - Additionally, Graph 2's edge appears to be colored orange/yellow while Graph 1's edge is gray\n   - Therefore, these graphs do not match"
