**Determining if Two Graphs Match**

To determine if the two graph images match, we must examine their structures, node connections, and any weights present.

**Graph 1:**

*   Node 0 is connected to Node 1 with an edge and Node 3 with an edge.
*   Node 1 is connected to Node 0 with an edge and Node 2 with an edge.
*   Node 2 is connected to Node 1 with an edge.
*   Node 3 is connected to Node 0 with an edge.

**Graph 2:**

*   Node 0 is connected to Node 1 with an edge and Node 3 with an edge.
*   Node 1 is connected to Node 0 with an edge and Node 2 with an edge.
*   Node 2 is connected to Node 1 with an edge.
*   Node 3 is connected to Node 0 with an edge.

**Comparison of Graph Structures:**

*   Both graphs have the same number of nodes (4) with identical labels (0, 1, 2, 3).
*   The connections between nodes in both graphs are identical, with Node 0 connected to Node 1 and Node 3, Node 1 connected to Node 0 and Node 2, and Node 2 connected to Node 1.
*   No weights are present on the edges in either graph.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the structures of both graphs, including node connections and the absence of weights, are identical, we can conclude that the two graphs match.

**Answer:**

```json
{
    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "Both graphs have the same number of nodes with identical labels and matching connections between nodes, resulting in a match without considering weights."
}
