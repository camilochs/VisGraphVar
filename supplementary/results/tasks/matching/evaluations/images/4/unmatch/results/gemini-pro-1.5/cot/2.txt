This check passes.\n2. **Edges (Graph 1):**\n   - Edge between 0 and 3\n   - Edge between 0 and 1\n3. **Edges (Graph 2):**\n   - Edge between 0 and 1\n4. **Comparison:** While both graphs share nodes 0,1,2, and 3 and have one edge between 0 and 1, Graph 1 has an additional edge between nodes 0 and 3 while Graph 2 does not.  Since both the edge counts and connections differ between the graphs, they do not match."
