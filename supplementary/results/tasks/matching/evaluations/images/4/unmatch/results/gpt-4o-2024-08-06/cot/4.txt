   "analysis": "Step 1: Check node counts - Both Graph 1 and Graph 2 have 4 nodes each, so the node counts match.\n\nStep 2: Compare node labels - Graph 1 nodes are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3; Graph 2 nodes are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3. Node labels match.\n\nStep 3: Compare connections/edges - Both graphs lack any edges, as there are no connecting lines between nodes in either graph. Edge presence matches (none in both).\n\nStep 4: Compare edge weights - Since there are no edges in either graph, edge weights do not need to be compared.\n\nConclusion: While node counts and labels match, the graphs do not differ otherwise. Without any edges to compare, these graphs are considered not matching in terms of structure beyond node properties."
