   "analysis": "1. Node Count Comparison:\n- Both graphs have 4 nodes each\n- Graph 1 has nodes labeled: 0, 1, 2, 3\n- Graph 2 has nodes labeled: 0, 1, 2, 3\n\n2. Edge Comparison:\n- Graph 1 has two edges forming a horizontal line connecting nodes 1-0-2, plus an isolated node 3\n- Graph 2 has two edges forming a vertical line connecting nodes 3-1-2, plus an isolated node 0\n\n3. Structure Comparison:\n- While both graphs have the same number of nodes and edges, their connectivity patterns are different\n- Graph 1 has a horizontal arrangement while Graph 2 has a vertical arrangement\n- The isolated nodes are different (3 in Graph 1, 0 in Graph 2)\n\nConclusion: The graphs do not match due to different connectivity patterns and different positions of isolated nodes."
