Node Count\n   - Graph 1 has 4 nodes.\n   - Graph 2 has 3 nodes.\n   Difference: Graph 2 has one fewer node.\n\n2. Node Labels in Graph 1:\n   - Node 1\n   - Node 6\n   - Node 7\n   - Node 9\n3. Node Labels in Graph 2:\n   - Node 2\n   - Node 3\n   - Node 4\n   Difference: Only node 4 is common between the graphs.\n\n4. Edges in Graph 1:\n   - Edge from Node 1 to Node 6\n   - Edge from Node 6 to Node 7\n\n5. Edges in Graph 2:\n   - Edge from Node 2 to Node 3\n   - Edge from Node 2 to Node 4\n\n6. Comparison of Edges\n   - Edge from Node 1 to Node 6 does not exist in Graph 2.\n   - Edge from Node 6 to Node 7 does not exist in Graph 2.\n   - Edge from Node 2 to Node 3 exists uniquely in Graph 2.\n   - Edge from Node 2 to Node 4 exists uniquely in Graph 2.\n\nConclusion: Given the differing number of nodes, the differing labels of the nodes, and the completely different sets of edges, the graphs do not match."
