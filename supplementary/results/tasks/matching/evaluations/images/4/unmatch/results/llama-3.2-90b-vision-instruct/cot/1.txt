To compare the two graphs, we need to examine their components closely. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1.  **Node Counts:**

    *   Graph 1 has 3 nodes.
    *   Graph 2 has 4 nodes.
    *   **Conclusion:** Since the node counts do not match (3 vs. 4), the graphs are not identical, but a closer look at node labels and edges is necessary for a definitive conclusion.

2.  **Node Labels:**

    *   Graph 1 nodes are labeled: 0, 1, and 2.
    *   Graph 2 nodes are labeled: 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    *   **Conclusion:** The presence of an additional node labeled "3" in Graph 2 indicates a difference in node labels, further suggesting the graphs are not identical.

3.  **Edge Connections and Weights:**

    *   **Graph 1 Edges:**
        *   From node 0 to node 1 (no weight specified).
        *   From node 0 to node 2 (no weight specified).
        *   From node 2 to node 3 (no weight specified, but node 3 is not present; this edge appears to connect to a non-existent node based on the provided labels, indicating an error or oversight in the graph description).
    *   **Graph 2 Edges:**
        *   From node 0 to node 1 (weight: 2).
        *   From node 0 to node 2 (weight: 1).
        *   From node 2 to node 3 (weight: 3).
    *   **Conclusion:** The edge connections and weights between the two graphs differ significantly. Graph 1 lacks weights and contains an edge to a supposedly non-existent node (edge from 2 to 3), while Graph 2 includes weighted edges and matches the edges to existing nodes.

Given these points of disparity, it is clear that the graphs do not match due to differences in node counts, labels, edge connections, and weights.
