**Matching Graph Analysis**

To determine if the two given graph images match, we will analyze their structures, node connections, and weights (if present). 

The first graph has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. There are 3 edges connecting these nodes: one between 0 and 3, one between 1 and 2, and one between 2 and 0.

The second graph also has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. There are 2 edges connecting these nodes: one between 0 and 3, and one between 1 and 0.

**Comparison of Structures and Connections**

*   Both graphs have 4 nodes with the same labels (0, 1, 2, 3).
*   Both graphs have a connection between nodes 0 and 3.
*   Both graphs have a connection between nodes 1 and 0, although the connection between 1 and 0 appears in a different position in Graph 2 compared to Graph 1.
*   Graph 1 has an additional connection between nodes 2 and 0.
*   Graph 1 has an additional connection between nodes 1 and 2.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the two graphs do not match due to differences in their structures and connections.
