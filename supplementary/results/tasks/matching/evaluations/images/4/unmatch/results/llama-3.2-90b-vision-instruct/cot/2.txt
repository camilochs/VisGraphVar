Both graphs have empty labels. They also share the same edges:

| Graph 1 | Node 1 | Node 2 | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Graph 1 | 3     | 0     |       |
| Graph 2 | 1     | 0     |       |

Another edge is present in each graph:

| Graph 1 | Node 1 | Node 2 | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Graph 2 | 1     | 0     |       |
| Graph 1 | 2     | 3     | 4     |

However, the second edge in Graph 1 is labeled "4", whereas the second edge in Graph 2 is missing a label. Graph 1 contains another edge: (2, 0) with weight '3'. While Graph 2 also contains this edge, but as (3, 0). As a result, the graphs are not identical.

**Answer:** 

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Although both graphs share the same structure, the differences in weights and labels distinguish the graphs from each other."
}
