Node counts match.\nStep 2: Node Labels - Both graphs have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. Node labels match.\nStep 3: Edges - Graph 1 has edges (0-1), (0-2), (0-3), (1-2). Graph 2 has edges (0-1), (1-2), (2-3), (3-0). Edges do not match.\nStep 4: Conclusion - The graphs have different connections between nodes, indicating they do not match."
