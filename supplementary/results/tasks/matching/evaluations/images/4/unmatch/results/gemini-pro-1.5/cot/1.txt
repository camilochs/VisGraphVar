  "analysis": "Graph 1 has nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. Graph 2 has nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. Both graphs have the same number of nodes, and the node labels are identical. However, examining the edges reveals differences. Graph 1 has edges (0, 1), (0, 2), while Graph 2 has edges (1, 2), (1, 3). Since the edge sets differ, the two graphs do not match."
