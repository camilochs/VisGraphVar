Edge Comparison:\n   - Graph 1 has one edge connecting nodes 0 and 2\n   - Graph 2 has one edge connecting nodes 1 and 3\n   Edges are in different locations.\n\n3. Graph Structure:\n   - Graph 1 shows a vertical connection between nodes 0 and 2, with isolated nodes 1 and 3\n   - Graph 2 shows a horizontal connection between nodes 1 and 3, with isolated nodes 0 and 2\n   Structures are different.\n\n4. Final Decision: Although both graphs have the same number of nodes and one edge each, the connections are between different pairs of nodes, making these graphs non-identical."
