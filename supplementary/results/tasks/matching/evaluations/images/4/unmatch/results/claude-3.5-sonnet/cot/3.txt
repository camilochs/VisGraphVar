Node Connections:\n- Graph 1 has one connection between nodes 1 and 2\n- Graph 2 has one connection between nodes 2 and 3\n- Different connection patterns\n\n3. Node Positions:\n- Graph 1: Nodes are scattered with 0 isolated, and 1-2 connected\n- Graph 2: Different arrangement with 0 and 1 isolated, and 2-3 connected\n\n4. Final Decision:\nWhile both graphs have the same number of nodes with the same labels, they differ in their connection patterns and overall structure, therefore they do not match."
