**Graph Comparison Analysis**

Given two graphs Graph 1 and Graph 2, we can perform a thorough node and edge analysis by examining each node and edge, including any existing weights, as follows:

**Step 1: Node Count and Label Comparison**

*   Graph 1 consists of 3 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).
*   Graph 2 comprises 3 unique nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).

Based on the counts and the labels, the match in node counts and matching node labels indicates that the node structure of both graphs are equivalent.

**Step 2: Edge and Weight Comparison**

*   Graph 1 includes the following edges and weights:
    *   - Edge (0, 1) with weight 4
    *   - Edge (0, 3) with weight 1
    *   - Edge (1, 0) with weight 4
    *   - Edge (1, 2) with weight 3
    *   - Edge (2, 1) with weight 5
    *   - Edge (2, 3) with weight 3
    *   - Edge (3, 0) with weight 1
    *   - Edge (3, 2) with weight 3
*   Graph 2 contains the following edges and weights:
    *   - Edge (0, 2) with weight 2
    *   - Edge (0, 3) with weight 0
    *   - Edge (1, 2) with weight 1
    *   - Edge (1, 3) with weight 0
    *   - Edge (2, 0) with weight 2
    *   - Edge (2, 1) with weight 1
    *   - Edge (2, 3) with weight 3
    *   - Edge (3, 0) with weight 0
    *   - Edge (3, 2) with weight 3

Comparing the edges and weights further highlights that these are not equivalent graphs as they are not connected in the same way and also have different weights among some edges.

**Conclusion**

Based on the step-by-step analysis:

```json
{
    "match": "no",
    "analysis": "Although both graphs have equal node count and matching node labels, connection and weights differ, hence Graph 1 does not match with Graph 2."
}
```

In this analysis, we evaluated each element of both graphs, specifically node count and connection weights. Both elements failed to be identical, revealing that the graphs are not equivalent.
