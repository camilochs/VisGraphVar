Node Counts:\n   - Graph 1 has 4 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).\n   - Graph 2 has 4 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Node Labels:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3.\n   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3.\n   - The node labels match.\n\n3. Edge Counts and Weights:\n   - Graph 1 has 3 edges: (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3).\n   - Graph 2 has 3 edges: (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3).\n   - The edge counts match, but the edge connections do not match exactly.\n\n4. Edge Connections:\n   - Graph 1 has edges connecting: (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3).\n   - Graph 2 has edges connecting: (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3).\n   - Although the node labels match, the specific edges connecting these nodes do not align exactly between the two graphs.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Despite having the same number of nodes and edges, the specific connections between the nodes do not match exactly between the two graphs.\n   - Therefore, the two graphs do not match."
