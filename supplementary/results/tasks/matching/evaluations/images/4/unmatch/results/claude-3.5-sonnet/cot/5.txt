Edge Analysis:\n   - Both graphs have 3 edges forming a linear path\n   - Graph 1 path: 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 2\n   - Graph 2 path: 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2\n\n3. Structure Analysis:\n   - While both graphs are linear paths with 4 nodes and 3 edges,\n   - The node ordering is different between the graphs\n   - Graph 1 follows sequence: 1-0-3-2\n   - Graph 2 follows sequence: 3-0-1-2\n\n4. Decision:\n   - Despite having the same number of nodes and edges,\n   - The different node ordering means these graphs are not isomorphic\n   - Therefore, they do not match"
