**Step 1: Compare the number of nodes and their labels.**

In Graph 1, there are 4 nodes labeled as 0, 1, 2, and 3. 

In Graph 2, there are also 4 nodes labeled as 0, 1, 2, and 3.

Since both graphs have the same number of nodes with matching labels, this aspect indicates a match.

**Step 2: Evaluate each connection or edge.**

In Graph 1, the edges are:

- From node 0 to node 3
- From node 1 to node 0
- From node 2 to node 1
- From node 3 to node 2

In Graph 2, the edges are:

- From node 0 to node 3
- From node 1 to node 0
- From node 2 to node 1
- From node 3 to node 2

Both graphs have the exact same edges connecting the same nodes, indicating a match in the edge configuration.

**Conclusion:**

Given that both graphs have the same number of nodes with matching labels and identical edge configurations, the conclusion is that these two graphs match.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "match": "yes", 
   "analysis": "The graphs have the same number of nodes with matching labels, and their edges connect in an identical manner, leading to the conclusion that the two graphs match."
}
```
