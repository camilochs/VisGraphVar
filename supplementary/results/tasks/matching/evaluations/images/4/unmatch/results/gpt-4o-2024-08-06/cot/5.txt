   "analysis": "Step 1: Compare node count - Both graphs have 4 nodes.\nStep 2: Compare node labels - Both graphs have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.\nStep 3: Compare edges - Graph 1 has edges (1, 0), (0, 3), (3, 2); Graph 2 has edges (3, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2). The sequence of connectivity matches when ignoring directionality and orientation.\nStep 4: Compare edge weights - No weights are present on either graph.\nFinal decision: Both graphs represent the same structure; therefore, they match."
