   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match because they have different node configurations. Graph 1 has a tree structure with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 2 positioned top to bottom respectively. Graph 2 has a tree structure as well, but the layout of the nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 is different. The edges and connections between the nodes do not align between the two graphs."
