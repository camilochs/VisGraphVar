Edges and Connections: Graph 1 has edges (0-1) and (0-2). Graph 2 has edges (1-2) and (1-3).\n4. Edge Weights: Graph 1 has uniform edges, while Graph 2 has edges with different colors; however, weights are not explicit.\n5. Conclusion: The node connections differ between the two graphs with different adjacency and structure; therefore, they do not match."
