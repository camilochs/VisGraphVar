Compare node labels:\n   - Both graphs have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. Compare connections/edges:\n   - Graph 1 has the following edges:\n     - Connects 0 to 1.\n     - Connects 0 to 2.\n     - Connects 0 to 3.\n     - Connects 1 to 3.\n   - Graph 2 has the following edges:\n     - Forms a quadrilateral connecting 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 0.\n\n4. Compare connection patterns:\n   - Graph 1 has connections forming a combination of a line and a triangle.\n   - Graph 2 has connections forming a quadrilateral.\n\n5. Based on visual inspection and step-by-step evaluation, the structures and connections do not match.\n\nConclusion:\n   - The two graphs do not match.\n"
