    "analysis": "While both graphs contain 4 nodes (labeled 0-3), they have different connection structures. Graph 1 has edges forming a more complex pattern with nodes connected in a triangular fashion plus additional connections. Graph 2 shows a simpler cyclic structure where nodes are connected in a square/diamond shape. The edge count and connection patterns are distinctly different between the two graphs."
