Node Position Analysis:\n   - Node positions differ between graphs:\n     * Graph 1: Node 0 is centrally located\n     * Graph 2: Node 0 is in the upper right\n     * Different spatial arrangements for other nodes\n\n3. Edge Analysis:\n   - Neither graph contains any edges between nodes\n\n4. Final Decision:\n   While both graphs have the same number of nodes with identical labels (0-3), they are arranged in different spatial configurations. Since graph isomorphism typically considers only connectivity and not spatial layout, these could be considered equivalent in terms of structure. However, as the question asks for exact matching including layout, these graphs do not match due to different node positions."
