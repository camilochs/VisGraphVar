To determine if the two graphs match, we need to analyze their structures and node connections. 

Graph 1 has a node labeled "1" with no connections to other nodes. It also has a subgraph consisting of nodes labeled "2", "0", and "3". Node "2" is connected to node "0", which is connected to node "3".

Graph 2 has a node labeled "2" with no connections to other nodes. It also has a subgraph consisting of nodes labeled "0", "1", and "3". Node "0" is connected to node "1", which is connected to node "3".

The two graphs have different structures and node connections. Graph 1 has an isolated node "1" and a subgraph with nodes "2", "0", and "3" following a linear topology, while Graph 2 has an isolated node "2" and a subgraph with nodes "0", "1", and "3" also following a linear topology but with reversed numbering.

**Answer:** 

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs have different isolated nodes and subgraph topologies, resulting in a mismatch."
}
```
