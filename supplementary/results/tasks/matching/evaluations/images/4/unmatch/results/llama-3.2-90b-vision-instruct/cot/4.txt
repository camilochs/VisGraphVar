### Node Comparison

* Graph 1 contains nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.
* Graph 2 also includes nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.

**Edges Comparison**

* Graph 1 has edges between nodes:
	+ 0 and 3 (weight: 3)
	+ 0 and 2 (weight: 2)
	+ 1 and 3 (weight: 0)
* Graph 2 features edges between nodes:
	+ 0 and 3 (weight: 0)
	+ 0 and 2 (weight: 2)
	+ 1 and 3 (weight: 3)

The weights of the edges between nodes 0 and 3, and nodes 1 and 3, differ between the two graphs.

**Conclusion**

Based on the mismatch in edge weights between nodes, the two graphs do not match.
