        "Step 2: Compare node labels. Nodes in Graph 1 are labeled 1, 0, 4, 5. Nodes in Graph 2 are labeled 0, 9, 7, 1, 3. Not all labels match.",
        "Step 3: Compare connections in Graph 1. There is a single edge from node 1 to node 0. Graph 2 does not show this connection.",
        "Step 4: Compare connections in Graph 2. There is one edge between nodes labeled 1 and 3.",
        "Conclusion: Due to differences in node labels and connections, the graphs do not match."
