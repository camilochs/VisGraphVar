**Determining Graph Equivalence through Visual Analysis**

To assess the equivalence of two graphs based on their images, we need to compare several key aspects:

1. **Number of Nodes**: Both graphs must have the same number of nodes.
2. **Node Connections (Edges)**: The pattern and direction (if applicable) of connections between nodes should be identical.
3. **Edge Weights**: If weights are associated with edges, these must match exactly in both graphs.

Given the constraints of visual inspection without explicit edge weights or directedness mentioned, we focus on node count and connectivity patterns. The steps to determine equivalence visually are:

- Count the nodes in each graph.
- Compare the connectivity pattern (which nodes are connected) in both graphs.

Upon inspection, Graph 1 shows a path from node 0 to node 2 with node 1 connecting them, ending at an isolated node 3. Graph 2 presents a path from node 1 to node 2 with node 3 connecting them, starting at an isolated node 0.

Despite visual inspection challenges without explicit labels for edge directions or weights, the described method outlines how equivalence could be determined with more detailed information.

**Answer:** Because the primary method here focuses on discrepancies without accounting for unlabeled directions or weights which might influence the outcome, and given the format's constraints preventing a detailed visual analysis beyond node counts (which match at 4 nodes each), a definitive 'yes' or 'no' is challenging without further data. However, adherence to the question's constraints necessitates a simplified answer model despite these limitations.
