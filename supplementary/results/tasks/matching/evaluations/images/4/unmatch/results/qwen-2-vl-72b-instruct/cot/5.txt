   "analysis": "Step-by-step explanation of each element compared and why the final decision was reached. First, compare the number of nodes and their labels. Both graphs have the same number of nodes and the same labels (0, 1, 2, 3). Next, compare the connections or edges. Graph 1 has edges between nodes 1-0, 0-3, and 3-2, while Graph 2 has edges between nodes 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3. The connections in Graph 2 do not align with those in Graph 1, so the graphs do not match."
