Additionally, there is another blue node labeled '2' that is not connected to any other nodes. In Graph 2, there is a green node labeled '1' connected by an orange edge to a green node labeled '0'. Also present are two other green nodes labeled '2' and '3' that are not connected to any other nodes. The structures and connections are distinctly different between the two graphs."
