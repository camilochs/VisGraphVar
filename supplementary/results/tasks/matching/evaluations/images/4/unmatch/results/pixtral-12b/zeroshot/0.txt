   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The graphs do not match because they have different structures and node connections. In Graph 1, there are three nodes labeled 2, 0, and 3 connected in a specific sequence. In contrast, Graph 2 contains four nodes labeled 0, 1, 1, and 3, showing a different arrangement without a corresponding matching sequence as seen in Graph 1."
}
```

Explanation:
- Graph 1 has three nodes (2, 0, 3) connected in a specific sequence: 2 -> 0 -> 3.
- Graph 2 has four nodes (0, 1, 1, 3) with a different sequence and connection alignment: 0 -> 1 -> 3.
- The nodes and their connections do not align in the same manner, resulting in different structures between the two graphs.
