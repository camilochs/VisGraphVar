    "analysis": "The graphs are different in several aspects: Graph 1 shows nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 with two separate components - one pair of connected nodes (2-3) and two isolated nodes (0 and 1). Graph 2 also has nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, but in a different configuration - one pair of connected nodes (0-3) and two isolated nodes (1 and 2). While both graphs have four nodes and one edge each, the connections and overall structure are not identical."
