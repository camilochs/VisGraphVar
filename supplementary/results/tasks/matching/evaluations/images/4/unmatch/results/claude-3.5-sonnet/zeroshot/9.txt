   "analysis": "The graphs are clearly different. Graph 1 shows a linear path of 3 connected nodes (1-0-2) plus an isolated node 3. Graph 2 shows a different linear path of 4 nodes (0-2-1-3) with all nodes connected in sequence. The structures, connections, and overall topology are not equivalent between the two graphs."
