   "analysis": "Step 1: Node Count - Graph 1 has 4 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3), Graph 2 also has 4 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3). Node count matches.\nStep 2: Node Labels - Both graphs have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3. Node labels match.\nStep 3: Edges - Graph 1 has edges 0-2. Graph 2 has edge 1-3. Edge connections do not match.\nStep 4: Edge Weights - Graph 1 appears to have unweighted edges, and Graph 2 also appears unweighted or uniformly weighted. Edge weights are not directly comparable but are not a differentiating factor here.\nConclusion: The graphs do not match due to differing edge connections."
