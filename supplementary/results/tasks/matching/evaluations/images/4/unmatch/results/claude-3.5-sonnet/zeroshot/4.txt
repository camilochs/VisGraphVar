    "analysis": "The graphs do not match. While both graphs contain the same number of nodes (4 nodes each), they have different node values and positions. Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 arranged in a specific pattern with nodes colored in blue, while Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 arranged in a different pattern with nodes colored in green. There are no visible connections (edges) between nodes in either graph, but the spatial arrangement of nodes differs between the two graphs."
