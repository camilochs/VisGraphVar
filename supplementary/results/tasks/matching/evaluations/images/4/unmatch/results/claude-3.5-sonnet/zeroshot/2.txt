    "analysis": "The graphs have different structures. Graph 1 shows nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 with a single edge connecting nodes 3 and 0. Graph 2 also has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 but with a different edge configuration - there is an edge connecting nodes 1 and 0. The node positions and connections are distinct between the two graphs, making them non-matching structures."
