   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels:\n   - Both graphs have 4 nodes labeled 0,1,2,3\n   - Node labels match but their positions differ\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n   - Graph 1 has 5 edges: (0-1), (0-2), (0-3), (1-2), (2-3)\n   - Graph 2 has 4 edges: (0-1), (0-3), (1-2), (2-3)\n   - Graph 2 is missing the edge between nodes 0 and 2 that exists in Graph 1\n\n3. Edge Patterns:\n   - Graph 1 forms a more interconnected pattern with crossing edges\n   - Graph 2 forms a simple cycle/quadrilateral\n\n4. Final Decision:\n   The graphs do not match because Graph 1 has one additional edge (0-2) that is not present in Graph 2, making their structures fundamentally different."
