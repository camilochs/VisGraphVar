   "analysis": "The node counts and labels of both graphs do not align. Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3, while Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. However, the connections between the nodes differ. In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2, while in Graph 2, node 0 is not connected to any other nodes. Additionally, the edges in Graph 2 have weights (orange lines), which are not present in Graph 1. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
