   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match because they have different connections or edges. Graph 1 has a node 0 connected to nodes 1 and 3, a node 1 connected to nodes 0 and 2, and a node 2 connected to node 1. Graph 2 has a node 0 connected to nodes 1 and 3, a node 1 connected to nodes 0 and 2, and a node 2 connected to node 3, which is a different connection. Therefore, the matching of edges does not match, and the graphs do not match."
