   "analysis": "Step-by-step explanation:\n1. Node Count:\n   - Graph 1 has 3 nodes.\n   - Graph 2 has 4 nodes.\n   Therefore, the number of nodes do not match.\n2. Node Labels:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 1, 3, 2.\n   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 4, 3, 5, 6.\n   There is no common labeling.\n3. Edge Count:\n   - Graph 1 has 2 edges.\n   - Graph 2 has 2 edges.\n   This could be coincidental but still not significant with different labels and numbers.\n4. Edge Weights:\n   Edges in both graphs can have weights, but since we do not have specific weight values given, one edge in Graph 2 is labeled orange.\n   Visual changes might be stylistic, but the primary issue remains.\nOverall, the discrepancies in node numbers, labels, andeddings indicate these graphs do not match.\n"
