Edge Comparison:\n- Graph 1 has one edge connecting nodes 2 and 3\n- Graph 2 has one edge connecting nodes 0 and 3\nEdges connect different pairs of nodes.\n\n3. Structure Analysis:\n- Graph 1 has connected components in the upper left, plus isolated nodes\n- Graph 2 has connected components on the right side, plus isolated nodes\nOverall structure differs.\n\n4. Final Decision:\nThe graphs do not match because they have different numbers of nodes and different edge connections between nodes."
