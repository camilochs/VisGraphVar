    "analysis": "The graphs are different in both structure and connectivity. Graph 1 shows nodes labeled 0, 1, and 2 with a vertical connection between nodes 0 and 2, while node 1 is isolated. Graph 2 shows nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 with a horizontal connection between nodes 1 and 3, while nodes 0 and 2 are isolated. They have different numbers of nodes (3 vs 4) and different connection patterns."
