To determine if the two given graph images match, we need to examine their structures, node connections, and any weights if present.

**Step 1: Structure Comparison**

*   Both graphs have the same number of nodes (4) and edges (3).
*   The nodes in both graphs are labeled with integers (0, 1, 2, 3).

**Step 2: Node Connection Comparison**

*   In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to node 1, node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 3.
*   In Graph 2, node 0 is connected to node 1, node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 3.

**Step 3: Weight Comparison (if any)**

*   There are no weights assigned to the edges in either graph.

Based on the comparison, we can conclude that the two graphs have the same structure, node connections, and no weights. Therefore, the graphs match.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "Both graphs have the same structure, node connections, and no weights, indicating they are identical."
}
```
