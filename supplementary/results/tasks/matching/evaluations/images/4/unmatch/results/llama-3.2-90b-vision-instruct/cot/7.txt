To determine if the two graphs match, we must analyze each part and compare nodes, connections, and weights.

**Node Analysis**

* Graph 1 contains three distinct nodes with the labels 0, 1, and 2.
* Graph 2 also contains three distinct nodes, labeled 0, 1, and 2.
* Both graphs exhibit identical node label configurations.

**Edge (Connection) Analysis**

* Graph 1 features three edges:
	+ Node 0 is connected to Node 2 with an edge and a weight of 0.
	+ Node 1 is connected to Node 2 with an edge and a weight of 0.
	+ A self-loop with a weight of 0 from Node 3 to itself.
* Graph 2 also features three edges:
	+ Node 0 is connected to Node 2 with an edge and a weight of 2.
	+ Node 1 is connected to Node 3 with an edge and a weight of 3.
	+ A self-loop from Node 2 to itself.
* Both graphs exhibit the same number of edges. However, the weight of Node 0 to Node 2 differs between Graph 1 and Graph 2, and a self-loop is present in Graph 1, while in Graph 2, a self-loop exists on Node 2. The edge configuration, though appearing similar in number, shows discrepancies in Node 0 to Node 2's weight and the self-loop positions.

**Determination of a Match**

* Upon examining both graphs' structures, it becomes clear they do not have identical configurations.
* The primary discrepancies lie in the weight of Node 0 to Node 2 (0 in Graph 1 and 2 in Graph 2) and the placement of self-loops (Node 3 in Graph 1 and Node 2 in Graph 2).
* Both examples demonstrate a similar architectural structure with three distinct nodes and three edges, each featuring a unique connection weight and a singular self-loop, albeit with variations in their constituent details.
