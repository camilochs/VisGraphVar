Node counts and labels:\n    - Graph 1 has nodes with labels 1, 0, and 2.\n    - Graph 2 has nodes with labels 2, 0, and another 0.\n    - The node count is the same, but the labels differ significantly.\n\n2. Node positions:\n    - The positions of nodes in Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not align in any way;\n    the layout and arrangement of the graphs are completely different.\n\n3. Edges (connections):\n    - Graph 1 has one connection between nodes labeled 1 and 0.\n    - Graph 2 has one connection between nodes labeled 2 and 0.\n    - The connections do not align in terms of both node labels and positions.\n\nGiven the differences in node labels and positions, as well as the mismatched edges, the two graphs do not match."
