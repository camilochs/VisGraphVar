**Step 1: Analyze the Images**

*   The first image shows a graph with an edge between nodes 1 and 2, an edge between nodes 1 and 3, and an edge between nodes 2 and 3.
*   The second image shows a graph with an edge between nodes 1 and 2, an edge between nodes 1 and 3, and an edge between nodes 2 and 3.

**Step 2: Determine if the Graphs Match**

Based on the analysis in Step 1, we can see that both graphs have the same structure and connections between nodes. Therefore, the graphs match.

**Answer**

```json
{
  "match": "yes",
  "analysis": "Both graphs have the same structure (two edges) and node connections."
}
```
