    "analysis": "The graphs have different structures and connections. Graph 1 shows 4 nodes (labeled 0, 1, 2, 3) with one edge connecting nodes 0 and 1. Graph 2 also has 4 nodes (labeled 0, 1, 2, 3) but with one edge connecting nodes 0 and 1 in a different spatial arrangement. The nodes are positioned differently in the two graphs, and while they have the same number of nodes and edges, their overall structure and layout make them non-identical."
