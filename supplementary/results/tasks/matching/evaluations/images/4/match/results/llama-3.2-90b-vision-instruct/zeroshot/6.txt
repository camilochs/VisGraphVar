**Step 1: Identify the structure of each graph.**

Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. The connections are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.

Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. The connections are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

**Step 2: Compare the structures for matching or non-matching.**

By comparing the connections in both graphs, it's clear that they do not have the same structure or node connections. Therefore, they do not match.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The graphs have different node connections, indicating they are not identical in structure."
}
