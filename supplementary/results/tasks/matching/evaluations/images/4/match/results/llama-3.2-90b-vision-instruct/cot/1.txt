**Step-by-Step Analysis**

**Step 1: Compare Node Counts and Labels**

*   Graph 1 has 3 nodes with labels 0, 1, and 3.
*   Graph 2 has 3 nodes with labels 0, 1, and 3.

**Step 2: Compare Connections or Edges**

*   Graph 1 has an edge connecting nodes 0 and 1 with no weights explicitly mentioned on the connection. Based on the general case representation of volcanic force in the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, this representation could be inferred as a zero-weight edge.
*   Graph 2 has an edge connecting nodes 0 and 1 with a weight of 1.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match because they have different weights on the edge connecting nodes 0 and 1.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The nodes and their labels match, but the edges connecting these nodes have different weights in each graph, causing them to not match."
}
