   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match each other. Graph 1 contains nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 with connections 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3. In contrast, Graph 2 contains nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 with connections 0-1, 1-2, and 2-3 but the order or direction of the graphs are different or it might be a visualization issue. Initially it seems they are identical, but they have different colors indicating different graphs."
