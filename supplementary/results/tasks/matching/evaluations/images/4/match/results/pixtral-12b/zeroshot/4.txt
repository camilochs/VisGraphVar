   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match because they do not have identical structures or node connections. In Graph 1, the nodes '3', '1', and '0' are connected in a linear sequence from left to right, whereas in Graph 2, the nodes '3', '0', and '1' are connected in a column from top to bottom. Additionally, the node '2' is only present in Graph 1 and absent in Graph 2. These structural and connectivity differences indicate that the graphs are not identical."
