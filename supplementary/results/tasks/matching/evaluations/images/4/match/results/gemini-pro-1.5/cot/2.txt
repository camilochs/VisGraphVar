Node 3 is disconnected.\nAlthough both graphs have matching labeled nodes, their edges differ. In Graph 1, the edge connects node 0 to node 1, and node 0 to node 2 represented by gray lines. In contrast, Graph 2 connects node 2 to node 0 and node 0 to node 1 by means of an orange colored line. Based on the differences in edges between graphs, the graphs do not match."
