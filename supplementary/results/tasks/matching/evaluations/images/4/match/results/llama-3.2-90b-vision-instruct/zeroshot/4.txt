**Analysis of Graph Similarity**

To determine if the two graphs match, we need to compare their structures, node connections, and weights.

**Graph 1:**
The first graph consists of three nodes labeled 0, 1, and 3. Node 0 is connected to node 1 with a weight of 0, and node 1 is connected to node 3 with a weight of 3. Node 2 is isolated with no connections.

**Graph 2:**
The second graph also has three nodes labeled 0, 1, and 3. Node 0 is connected to node 1 with a weight of 0, and node 1 is connected to node 3 with a weight of 3. However, node 2 is not isolated but has a connection to node 3 with a weight of 2.

**Comparison:**
Despite having similar structures and weights for nodes 0, 1, and 3, the significant difference lies in the handling of node 2. In Graph 1, node 2 is isolated, whereas in Graph 2, it is connected to node 3. This discrepancy indicates that the graphs do not match.

**Response:**
```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The graphs differ in the connection of node 2; Graph 1 has node 2 isolated, while Graph 2 connects it to node 3 with a weight of 2."
}
