  "analysis": "While both graphs have the same number of nodes (4), the connections between the nodes differ. For instance, in Graph 1, node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. In Graph 2, nodes 0, 1, and 3 form a connected triangle, and node 2 is connected only to node 3. These differences in the edge configurations show that the graphs are not isomorphic."
