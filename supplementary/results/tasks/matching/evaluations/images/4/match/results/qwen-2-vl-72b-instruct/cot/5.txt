{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match because they have different edge connections. Graph 1 has edges connecting nodes in a descending order (3 to 2, 2 to 1, 1 to 0), while Graph 2 has edges connecting nodes in an ascending order (0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3). The node labels and counts are the same, but the edge connections are different, indicating they do not match."
