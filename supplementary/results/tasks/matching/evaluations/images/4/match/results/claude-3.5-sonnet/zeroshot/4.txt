   "analysis": "While both graphs contain nodes labeled 0-3, they have different structures. Graph 1 shows a linear path connecting nodes 3-1-0 with node 2 isolated. Graph 2 shows a linear path connecting nodes 3-1-0 in a vertical arrangement with node 2 isolated. Although they have similar components, their spatial arrangements and edge connections differ visually."
