Connection Pattern Check:\n- Graph 1 has connections:\n  * 0-1\n  * 0-2\n  * 0-3\n  * 1-3\n- Graph 2 has connections:\n  * 0-1\n  * 0-2\n  * 0-3\n  * 1-3\n\n4. Graph Structure:\n- Both graphs form the same star-like pattern with node 0 as a central hub\n- Both have the same triangle formation between nodes 0, 1, and 3\n\nConclusion: While the graphs are drawn differently (with different layouts and colors), they are structurally identical with the same nodes and connections, making them isomorphic graphs."
