Edge Analysis:\n   - Both graphs have 5 edges\n   - Graph 1 connections (blue):\n     * 0-1\n     * 0-2\n     * 0-3\n     * 2-3\n   - Graph 2 connections (green):\n     * 0-1\n     * 0-2\n     * 0-3\n     * 2-3\n\n3. Structure Analysis:\n   - Both graphs form similar triangular structures with an additional connection\n   - The relative positions of nodes might appear different, but the connectivity pattern is identical\n   - No weights are shown on edges in either graph\n\nConclusion: The graphs are isomorphic - they have the same number of nodes, identical connections between corresponding nodes, and maintain the same structural relationships, just with different visual layouts."
