Node Count and Labels:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 4, 5, 6, and 9.\n   - Node labels are different, so they do not match on this criterion.\n2. Edge/Connection Count and Labels:\n   - Graph 1 has edges connecting nodes 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 6, and 6 to 2.\n   - Graph 2 has edges connecting nodes 4 to 6, 6 to 5, and 6 to 9.\n   - The edges and their connections are entirely different, further confirming they do not match.\nTherefore, based on the node labels and the connections, the graphs do not match."
