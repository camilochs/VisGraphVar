   "analysis": "The graphs do not match. Although they have the same number of nodes, the connections between the nodes are different. In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. In Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3, but the edges appear to be of different lengths, suggesting different weights or distances, even though the actual weights are not provided in the images."
