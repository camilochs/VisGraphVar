Node Position Analysis:\n   - Graph 1: Node arrangement shows nodes 0-1 connected at bottom, nodes 2 and 3 isolated\n   - Graph 2: Node arrangement shows nodes 0-1 connected at right, nodes 2 and 3 isolated\n   - Node positions differ\n\n3. Edge Analysis:\n   - Graph 1: One edge connecting nodes 0-1 horizontally\n   - Graph 2: One edge connecting nodes 0-1 vertically\n   - While both graphs have same number of edges, their orientations differ\n\n4. Overall Structure:\n   - Despite having same number of nodes and edges, the spatial arrangement and orientation of components differs between graphs\n   - This results in different graph structures\n\nConclusion: While the graphs have the same number of components, their structural arrangements differ, making them non-matching graphs."
