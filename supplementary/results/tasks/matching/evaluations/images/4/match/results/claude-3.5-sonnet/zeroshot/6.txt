    "analysis": "While both graphs contain 4 nodes labeled 0-3, they have different structures and connections. Graph 1 has node 2 connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3 in a Y-like shape, while Graph 2 has a more triangular structure between nodes 1, 2, and 3, with node 0 connected only to node 2. The edge patterns and overall topology are distinctly different between the two graphs."
