   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "Step 1: Node Count - Both graphs have 4 nodes. Step 2: Node Labels - Both graphs have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. Step 3: Edges - Graph 1 has edges (0-2, 1-2, 1-3) and Graph 2 has edges (0-2, 1-2, 1-3). Step 4: Edge Comparison - All edges in Graph 1 are present in Graph 2 without weights, hence they match. Final Decision - All elements (nodes and edges) match between the graphs."
