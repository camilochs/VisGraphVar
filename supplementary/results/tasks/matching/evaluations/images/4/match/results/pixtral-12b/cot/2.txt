   "analysis": "Step-by-step explanation of each element compared and why the final decision was reached:\n\n1. Node Count comparison:\n   - Graph 1: 4 nodes (with labels 1, 2, 3, and 4)\n   - Graph 2: 4 nodes (with labels 1, 2, 3, and 4)\n   The node counts are the same for both graphs.\n\n2. Node Pair comparison:\n   - In Graph 1, node 1 connects directly to node 4 (nodes 2 and 3 are disconnected).\n   - In Graph 2, node 1 connects to node 3, then node 3 connects to node 2 (node 4 is disconnected).\n   The connections in the two graphs do not match in pattern or sequence.\n\n3. Visual Position comparison:\n   - The positions of the обеспечиваемого nodes are not clustered similarly or along identical pathways in both graphs. \n\nConclusion: The node connections (sequence and structure) and their visual organization are different between the two graphs. Hence, the graphs do not match."
