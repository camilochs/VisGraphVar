    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 4 nodes each (labeled 0-3)\n2. Node Labels: Both graphs use the same numerical labels (0,1,2,3)\n3. Edge Count: Both graphs have 3 edges\n4. Edge Pattern:\n   - Graph 1: Forms a line from node 3→2→1→0\n   - Graph 2: Forms a line from node 0→1→2→3\n5. Structure: Both graphs represent linear paths with 4 nodes and 3 edges\n6. Key Observation: The only difference is the direction/orientation (one is ascending 0-3, the other descending 3-0), but topologically they are identical\n7. Conclusion: The graphs match as they have identical structure, just with different orientations"
