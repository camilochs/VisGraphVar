Edge Comparison:\n   - Graph 1 has edges (3, 2), (2, 1), and (1, 0), forming a linear path.\n   - Graph 2 has edges (3,2) , (2,1) and (1,0) reflected over an axis to form a linear path also.\n    Even if the graph is the same in terms of number of nodes and connections, the nodes are mapped differently, hence not isomorphic and do not match."
