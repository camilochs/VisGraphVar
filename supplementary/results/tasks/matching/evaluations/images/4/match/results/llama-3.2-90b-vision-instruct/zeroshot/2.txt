Given that you only provided a single image, I will assume the same image represents both graphs for the sake of this problem.

### Graph Analysis

To analyze the graphs, the steps are as follows:
*   Annotate the edges and vertices with unique identifiers (1, 2, 3)
*   Calculate the degree of each vertex in the graphs (number of edges incident on each vertex).
*   Compare weights of given edges, if any.

### JSON output for analysis of graph matching if the single image is considered for both graphs:
```json
{
   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "The graph has identical network structures and labels. Identical edges and nodes along with equal weights (if present) match exactly."
}
```
