Edge Analysis:\n- Both graphs are trees (no cycles)\n- Both graphs have 3 edges\n- Graph 1 has edges: (0-1), (0-2), (0-3)\n- Graph 2 has edges: (0-1), (0-2), (0-3)\n- Node 0 is the central node in both graphs\n\n3. Structure:\n- Both graphs show a star topology with node 0 as the center\n- All other nodes (1, 2, 3) are leaf nodes connected only to node 0\n\n4. Layout:\n- Although the visual layout is slightly different (Graph 1 uses gray/blue colors and Graph 2 uses green with orange edges), the underlying structure is identical\n\nConclusion: The graphs are isomorphic - they have the same number of nodes, same connections, and same overall structure, just displayed with different visual styling and slight positional differences."
