Edge Count Check:\n   - Graph 1 has 1 edge (connecting nodes 3-0)\n   - Graph 2 has 1 edge (connecting nodes 0-3)\n   - Edge count matches but different connections\n\n3. Structure Check:\n   - Graph 1: Edge connects nodes 3-0, with nodes 1 and 2 isolated\n   - Graph 2: Edge connects nodes 0-3, with nodes 1 and 2 isolated\n   - While both graphs have similar components, the specific connections are different\n\n4. Final Decision: The graphs do not match because although they have the same number of nodes and edges, the connectivity pattern is different between the two graphs."
