Based on the graph images, the two graphs display distinct structural characteristics. Graph 1 consists of four nodes {0,1,2,3} and comprises five edges. Conversely, Graph 2 comprises three nodes {0,1,2} and three edges, denoted by the orange lines. This difference is a crucial observation. Therefore, considering the structural features and connections depicted visually in the graphs, they do not match.

**Response in JSON format:**

   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Successive observation of both images, with varifying context and connections, do not match up. Graph 1 contains five edges against three edges in Graph 2."
