{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Graph 1 and Graph 2 have the same number of nodes but differ in their connections. Graph 1 has a single edge between nodes 0 and 1, whereas Graph 2 has an edge between nodes 0 and 1 with a different appearance (e.g., color indicating weight or directed connection). The other nodes (2 and 3) are isolated in both graphs. Thus, the graphs do not match due to the difference in edge properties."
