   "analysis": "1. Node Count Comparison:\n   - Both graphs contain 4 nodes each\n   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0,1,2,3\n   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0,1,2,3\n\n2. Edge Comparison:\n   - Graph 1 has two edges forming a linear path between nodes 2-0-1\n   - Graph 2 has two edges forming a linear path between nodes 2-0-1\n   - However, node 3 is positioned differently:\n     * In Graph 1, node 3 is isolated on the left side\n     * In Graph 2, node 3 is isolated on the right side\n\n3. Edge Style:\n   - Graph 1 uses gray/blue edges\n   - Graph 2 uses orange/yellow edges\n\nConclusion: While the graphs have the same number of nodes and similar linear connections between nodes 2-0-1, they differ in the positioning of node 3 and edge coloring. Therefore, they are not exact matches."
