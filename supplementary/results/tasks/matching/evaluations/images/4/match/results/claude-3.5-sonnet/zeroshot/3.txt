    "analysis": "The graphs are isomorphic, meaning they have the same structure despite different node numbering and visual layout. Both graphs contain 4 nodes and 4 edges, with identical connection patterns. In both graphs, there is one node connected to three others (node 3 in Graph 1 and node 3 in Graph 2), while the remaining nodes each have two connections. The only difference is the node labeling and spatial arrangement, but the underlying structure is exactly the same."
