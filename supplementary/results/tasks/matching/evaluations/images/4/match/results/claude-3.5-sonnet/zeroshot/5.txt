    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "Both graphs show a linear chain of 4 nodes (numbered 0-3), with identical structure but different orientations. Graph 1 displays a downward diagonal line from node 3 to 0, while Graph 2 shows an upward diagonal line from node 3 to 0. Despite the different orientations, they represent the same graph structure with identical node connections and sequential ordering."
