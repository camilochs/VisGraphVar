**Graph Matching Analysis**

### Input Graphs

**Graph 1:**
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": 0, "label": "A" },
    { "id": 1, "label": "B" },
    { "id": 2, "label": "C" },
    { "id": 3, "label": "D" }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "source": 0, "target": 1, "weight": 1 },
    { "source": 0, "target": 2, "weight": 2 },
    { "source": 0, "target": 3, "weight": 3 }
  ]
}
```

**Graph 2:**
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": 3, "label": "D" },
    { "id": 2, "label": "C" },
    { "id": 1, "label": "B" },
    { "id": 0, "label": "A" }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "source": 3, "target": 2, "weight": 2 },
    { "source": 3, "target": 1, "weight": 1 },
    { "source": 3, "target": 0, "weight": 3 }
  ]
}
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Node Count Comparison:**
   - Both graphs have 4 nodes.
   
2. **Node Label Comparison:**
   - Graph 1: [A, B, C, D]
   - Graph 2: [D, C, B, A]
   - Although the order differs, both graphs contain the same set of node labels, indicating a match.

3. **Edge Comparison:**
   - Graph 1 Edges: [(A, B, 1), (A, C, 2), (A, D, 3)]
   - Graph 2 Edges: [(D, C, 2), (D, B, 1), (D, A, 3)]
   - By reordering edges for comparison and considering the bidirectional nature of edges in this context, both graphs have the same set of edges, each connecting the corresponding nodes with the same weights but from a different perspective.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the comparisons above, the graphs match despite the difference in node and edge order because the nodes and edges are identical when considering the bidirectional nature of graph connections and allowing for a node and edge reordering.

**Output Response**
```json
{
  "match": "yes",
  "analysis": "Both graphs have the same node labels and edge weights when considering reordering and the bidirectional nature of connections."
}
```
