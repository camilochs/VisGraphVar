Both graphs have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3. \nStep 3: Compare edges. \n- Graph 1 edges: 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 2-3. \n- Graph 2 edges: 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 2-3. \nStep 4: Compare edge weights. Both graphs have no weights specified, assuming all edges are unweighted or have equal weights. \nConclusion: All elements (nodes, edges, labels) match. Therefore, the graphs match."
