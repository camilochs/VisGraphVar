For the reason that the provided prompt contains images graph1.png and graph2.png, but the actual image data is not available here, the determination of whether the two graphs images match or not, implying identical structures, node connections, and weights, cannot be performed. However, a general method of comparing two graphs would involve checking their vertex sets, edge sets, and edge weights. 

An algorithmic approach could involve the following steps:

1. Extract the vertex sets (V1, V2) and edge sets (E1, E2) for both graphs.
2. Compare the vertex sets to ensure they are identical in terms of both count and vertex properties (like vertex labels).
3. Compare the edges sets, ensuring that for every edge in one graph, there exists a corresponding edge in the other with the same connecting vertices and weight (if weighted).
4. If both the vertex sets and edge sets match exactly, and the weights (if present) also match, then the graphs are considered identical. Otherwise, they are different.

Given this, I cannot perform the actual comparison since the specific graphs are not visible.
