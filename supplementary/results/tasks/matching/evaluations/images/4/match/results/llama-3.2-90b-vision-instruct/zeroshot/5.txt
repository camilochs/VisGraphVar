**Image 1: Graph 1**

Nodes:
- 0 (connected to 1 and 3)
- 1 (connected to 0 and 2)
- 2 (connected to 1 and 3)
- 3 (connected to 0, 2, and has a weight of 3)

Image 2: Graph 2

Nodes:
- 0 (connected to 1 and 2)
- 1 (connected to 0 and 2)
- 2 (connected to 0, 1, and 3)
- 3 (has a weight of 0)

Analysis:

Both graphs have identical node connections. In Graph 1, node 3 has a weight of 3. In Graph 2, node 3 has a weight of 0. Since the weights on node 3 in the two graphs are different, the graphs do not match.

**Answer:** 
```json
{
    "match": "no",
    "analysis": "The graphs have the same structure and node connections, but the weights on node 3 are different."
}
```
