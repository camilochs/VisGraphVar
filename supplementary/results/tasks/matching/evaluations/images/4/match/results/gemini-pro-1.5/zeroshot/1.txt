  "analysis": "Graph 1 has an edge between nodes 0 and 1, and isolated nodes 2 and 3. Graph 2 has an edge between nodes 0 and 1, and isolated nodes 2 and 3. However, the edge (0, 1) in Graph 2 is highlighted in orange, while in Graph 1 it is a standard edge color. Therefore, the two graphs do not match visually, even if the underlying graph structure is the same."
