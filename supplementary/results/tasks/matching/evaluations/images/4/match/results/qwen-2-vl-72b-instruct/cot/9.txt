   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match. Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n1. Node counts: Both graphs have 4 nodes each.\n2. Node labels: The node labels are different. Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3, while Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 but in a different order.\n3. Edge connections: The edge connections are different. In Graph 1, there are edges between nodes (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3). In Graph 2, there are edges between nodes (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3) but the labels and order are different. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
