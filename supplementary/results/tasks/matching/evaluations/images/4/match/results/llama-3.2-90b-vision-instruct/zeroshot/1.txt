Given that no images are provided, it is impossible to examine the graph images and determine if they match. Please provide the graph images for a detailed analysis.

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "No images were provided for analysis."
}
```

**Step-by-Step Approach:**

1.  **Examine** the provided graph images if they were provided.
2.  **Determine Structure**: Check if the structure of both graphs is identical.
3.  **Compare Node Connections**: Verify if each node and its connections in graph 1 match exactly with those in graph 2.
4.  **Check Weights**: If present, compare the weights of the edges in both graphs.
5.  **Conclusion**: Based on steps 2-4, decide if the graphs match ("yes") or not ("no") and provide a brief analysis.

Please note that without the actual images, we cannot proceed with the analysis.
