   "analysis": "The two graphs have different structures and node connections. In Graph 1, there are nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. In Graph 2, there are nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 as well. However, the connections between nodes are different. In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. In Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. However, the order of the connections is different. In Graph 1, the order is 0-1, 0-2, and 0-3. In Graph 2, the order is 0-1, 0-2, and 0-3. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
