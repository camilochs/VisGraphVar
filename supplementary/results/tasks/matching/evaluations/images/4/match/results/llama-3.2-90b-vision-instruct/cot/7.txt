**Step 1: Compare Node Counts**

Graph 1 has 3 nodes (0, 1, 3) and Graph 2 also has 3 nodes (0, 1, 2). Both graphs have the same number of nodes.

**Step 2: Compare Node Labels**

Node labels in Graph 1 are 0, 1, 3. Node labels in Graph 2 are 0, 1, 2. The labels do not match exactly because Graph 1 has node 3 and Graph 2 has node 2 instead.

**Step 3: Compare Edges and Connections**

Graph 1 has an edge from node 0 to node 3. Graph 2 has edges from node 0 to node 3 and from node 0 to node 1. The connection pattern does not match between the two graphs.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the comparison of node counts, labels, and edges, the two graphs do not match. The mismatch in node labels and edge connections indicates they are different graphs.

**Answer in JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "The graphs have different node labels at the third node (3 in Graph 1 vs. 2 in Graph 2) and different edge connections (an additional edge from 0 to 1 in Graph 2 not present in Graph 1)."
}
