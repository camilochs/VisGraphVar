**Graph Comparison Analysis**

### Step-by-Step Comparison

1. **Node Count Comparison:**
   * Graph 1 has 3 nodes.
   * Graph 2 has 3 nodes.
   * Nodes in both graphs align in count.

2. **Node Label Comparison:**
   * Graph 1 nodes are labeled '0', '1', '2'.
   * Graph 2 nodes are labeled '0', '1', '2'.
   * Nodes in both graphs align in labels.

3. **Edge Comparison:**
   * Graph 1 has edges from '0' to '1' and from '0' to '2'.
   * Graph 2 has edges from '0' to '1', '0' to '3', and '3' to '2'.
   * Graph 1 has an edge '0' to '1' and an edge '0' to '2', implying the '2' node is directly connected to '0'. An edge '0' to '1' is also found, but the edge from '0' to '2' is not connected to '2' directly as in graph 1, instead coming from the node '3' which is not present in graph 1.

**Final Decision**
Based on the comparison above, it is clear that although the number of nodes and their labels match, the edges do not. The final decision is that the graphs do not match.

**JSON Output:**

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The graphs have the same number of nodes (3) and share the same labels (0, 1, 2). However, they do not match because the edges (connections between nodes) are different in arrangement. Graph 1's '0' to '2' connection directly connects '0' to '2', whereas in Graph 2, this connection involves an additional node '3' not present in Graph 1."
