   "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels:\n- Both graphs have 4 nodes\n- Graph 1 has nodes labeled: 0, 1, 2, 3\n- Graph 2 has nodes labeled: 0, 1, 2, 3\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n- Graph 1 has edges:\n  * 3-2\n  * 3-1\n  * 3-0\n  * 1-0\n- Graph 2 has edges:\n  * 2-3\n  * 3-0\n  * 3-1\n  * 1-0\n\n3. Structure Differences:\n- While both graphs have the same number of nodes and similar edge connections, the overall structure is different\n- Graph 1 has node 3 as a central hub connecting to nodes 0, 1, and 2\n- Graph 2 has a more linear arrangement with node 2 connecting only to node 3\n\n4. Final Decision:\nThe graphs do not match because despite having the same number of nodes, the connectivity pattern is different, particularly in how node 2 connects to the rest of the graph."
