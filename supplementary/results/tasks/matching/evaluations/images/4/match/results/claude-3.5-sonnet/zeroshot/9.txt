    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "Both graphs show identical structural patterns with 4 nodes (labeled 0,1,2,3) and identical connections between them. The graphs have the same triangular formation with node 0 as a central point connected to all other nodes, and nodes 2 and 3 connected to each other. The only difference is the visual layout and colors, but topologically they are the same graph."
