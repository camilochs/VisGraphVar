   "analysis": "The node labels in the first graph are 0, 1, 2, and 3, while in the second graph, they are 0, 1, and 3. The edge connections also differ: in the first graph, node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 1 is connected to node 0. In the second graph, node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 1 is connected to node 0. The main difference is that the second graph is missing the node labeled 2, and its connections differ."
