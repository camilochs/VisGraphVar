  "analysis": "Graph 1 has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. Graph 2 also has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. However, the edges differ. Graph 1 has edges (0, 1) and (1, 3). Graph 2 has edges (0, 1), (1, 3), but also an isolated node 2. Because the connections are not the same between correspondingly labeled nodes, the graphs do not match."
