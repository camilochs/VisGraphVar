Graph 1 has edges between nodes 0-1 and 1-3. Node 2 is isolated.\nGraph 2 has edges between nodes 0-1 and 1-3. Node 2 is isolated.\nStep 3: Compare edge weights if any. Graph 1 has no weights indicated. Graph 2 shows a visual difference in edge color, suggesting possible weights or directions.\nStep 4: Conclusion. While the labels and the structure of edges initially appear similar, the difference in edge presentation (color/weight) suggests they do not fully match."
