**Graph Comparison Analysis**

After analyzing the graphs, here are my findings:

**Node Labels:**

* Graph 1: The nodes are labeled as 0, 1, 2, and 3.
* Graph 2: The nodes are also labeled as 0, 1, 2, and 3.

All node labels match, so we can proceed to compare the edges.

**Edges:**

* Graph 1:
	+ Edge 0-1 with weight 2
	+ Edge 0-2 with weight 0
	+ Edge 1-2 with weight 3
	+ Edge 1-3 with weight 1
	+ Edge 2-3 with weight 0
* Graph 2:
	+ Edge 0-1 with weight 2
	+ Edge 0-2 with weight 0
	+ Edge 1-2 with weight 3
	+ Edge 1-3 with weight 1
	+ Edge 2-3 with weight 0

All edge weights and node connections match exactly.


**Conclusion:**

Since all node labels and edge connections match exactly, I conclude that the two graphs are identical.
