   "analysis": "Comparing the two graphs, Graph 1 and Graph 2 have different node counts and labels. Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3, while Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 in a different order. Additionally, the connections or edges between the nodes are different. Graph 1 has an edge between nodes 0 and 1, while Graph 2 has an edge between nodes 0 and 1 with a different weight. Therefore, the two graphs do not match."
