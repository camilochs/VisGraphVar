**Graph Comparison Analysis**

Upon examining the provided graphs, it is evident that both graphs are identical in terms of node count and labels. Both graphs consist of four nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.

**Node Count and Labels Comparison**

| Graph | Nodes | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graph 1 | 4 | [0, 1, 2, 3] |
| Graph 2 | 4 | [0, 1, 2, 3] |

Both graphs exhibit the same node count and identical labels, indicating a match in this aspect.

**Connection (Edge) Comparison**

To determine if the two graphs match, we must also evaluate their connections or edges, including any associated weights. 

| Edge | Graph 1 Weight | Graph 2 Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0-2 | 0 | 0 |
| 1-2 | 1 | 1 |
| 1-3 | 0 | 0 |
| 2-3 | 2 | 2 |

The edge weights and combinations are identical in both graphs.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis of both node count and labels, as well as the connections (edges) including weights, it is clear that these two graphs are matching. Both graphs share the same structural components, including the arrangement and weights of their edges.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "The two graphs match as they have the same node count and labels. Furthermore, when comparing edges, including their weights, both graphs also align in this aspect. Therefore, the conclusion is that the graphs are equivalent."
