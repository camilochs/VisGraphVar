   "analysis": "Step-by-step comparison of the two graphs revealed differences in their connections and node labels. In the first graph, nodes 0 and 3 are connected, while in the second graph, nodes 0 and 3 are connected with a different connection. Additionally, there are nodes with the same labels in different positions. Therefore, the final decision is that the graphs do not match."
