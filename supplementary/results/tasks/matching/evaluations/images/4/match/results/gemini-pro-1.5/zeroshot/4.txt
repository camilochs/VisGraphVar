  "analysis": "Graph 1 has edges (1, 3), (0, 1), while Graph 2 has edges (0, 1), (1, 3). Although both graphs have the same nodes and the same number of edges, the connectivity structure within the graphs is different due to different edge placements.  For example, node 2 is an isolated node in Graph 1, but not in Graph 2, and the edge placement also varies between graphs. Therefore, the graphs don't match."
