   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match. Here is the step-by-step explanation of each element compared:\n\n1. Node Counts: Both graphs have the same number of nodes (4 nodes each).\n2. Node Labels: Both graphs have the same node labels (0, 1, 2, 3).\n3. Connection or Edge Evaluation:\n   - Graph 1 has the following connections: [2-3, 3-1, 1-0].\n   - Graph 2 has the following connections: [2-3, 3-1, 1-0, 3-0].\n\nThe difference lies in the extra connection between nodes 3 and 0 in Graph 2, which is not present in Graph 1. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
