### Analysis:

1. **Node Count and Labels:**
   - Graph 1 has four nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 0.
   - Graph 2 has five nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 0.

   Since the node counts and labels do not match, these graphs cannot be identical. Specifically, Graph 1 is missing the node labeled 4 that exists in Graph 2. Additionally, Graph 2 includes an extra node (labeled 4) that does not exist in Graph 1.

2. **Connections (Edges):**
   - **Graph 1:**
      - Node 1 is connected to node 2.
      - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
      - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
      - Node 0 is connected to node 2.
   - **Graph 2:**
      - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
      - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
      - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
      - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
      - Node 0 is connected to node 5.

   The structure of connections in the common nodes (1, 2, and 3) does not fully match because node 3 in Graph 1 connects to nodes 1 and 2, whereas in Graph 2, node 3 connects to nodes 4 and 5. Also, node 1 in Graph 2 connects to node 4, and node 0 connects to node 5, which are not present in corresponding connections in Graph 1.

3. **Conclusion:**
   Based on the differences in node count, node labels, and connections, it is conclusive that Graph 1 and Graph 2 are not identical.
