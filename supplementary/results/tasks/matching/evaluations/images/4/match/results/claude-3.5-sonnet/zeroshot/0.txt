    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "Both graphs have identical structural properties: they each contain 4 nodes and 4 edges forming a similar star-like pattern. Although the node numbering and visual layout differ slightly between the graphs, and they use different colors (blue vs green), the underlying connectivity pattern is the same. Each graph has a central node (node 0) connected to three other nodes, forming the same topological structure."
