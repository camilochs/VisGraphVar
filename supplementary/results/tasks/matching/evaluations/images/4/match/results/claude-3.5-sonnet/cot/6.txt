    "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels: Both graphs have 4 nodes each, labeled 0,1,2,3. However, their arrangements are different.\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\nGraph 1:\n- Edge between 0 and 2\n- Edge between 1 and 2\n- Edge between 1 and 3\n- Edge between 2 and 3\n\nGraph 2:\n- Edge between 0 and 2\n- Edge between 1 and 2\n- Edge between 1 and 3\n- Edge between 2 and 3\n\n3. While both graphs have the same number of edges (4) and connect the same numbered nodes, they represent different structures. Graph 1 forms a more compact arrangement with node 2 in the center, while Graph 2 has a more linear arrangement with different spatial relationships between the nodes.\n\n4. Although the graphs contain the same components, they represent different topological arrangements, therefore they do not match."
