    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "Both graphs show the same structural pattern with 4 nodes connected in a star-like formation. Each graph has a central node (labeled 0) connected to three other nodes (labeled 1, 2, and 3). The connections and overall topology are identical, with the only difference being the visual layout and colors used to represent the graphs. While Graph 1 uses blue nodes and Graph 2 uses green nodes, the underlying structure and node relationships remain the same."
