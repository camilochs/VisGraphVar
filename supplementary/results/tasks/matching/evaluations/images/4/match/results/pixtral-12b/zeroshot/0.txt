   "analysis": "While both Graph 1 and Graph 2 have four nodes each and similar connections in terms of structure, they are not identical. The key difference is in the visual representation: the nodes in Graph 1 are light blue, and in Graph 2, they are green. Additionally, the connections in Graph 1 are gray, whereas the connections in Graph 2 are orange. The node labels and the arrangement of the nodes are identical, but the color differentiation suggests that they are not the same graph."
