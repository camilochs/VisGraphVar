   "analysis": "The graphs do not match because their structures and node connections are different. Graph 1 has a node with the label '2' connected to three other nodes ('0', '1', and '3'), while in Graph 2, the node with the label '2' is connected to nodes '1' and '3'. Additionally, Graph 1 has a node '0' connected only to node '2', whereas in Graph 2, node '0' is connected to node '2'. The colors of the nodes and edges also differ between the two graphs."
