   "analysis": "Both graphs have 4 nodes with the same labels (0, 1, 2, 3). However, the connections between the nodes differ. In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3, while in Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3. The edge between nodes 0 and 2 exists in Graph 1 but not in Graph 2. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
