  "analysis": "Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. Graph 2 also has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. In Graph 1, there is an edge between nodes 0 and 3. In Graph 2, there is also an edge between nodes 0 and 3. However, the positions of the nodes with the same labels are different in the two graphs. For example, Node 1 is isolated and located on the left side in Graph 1 but isolated and on the right side, above Node 2, in Graph 2.  Although the connections are the same, the spatial arrangement and positioning of equivalent nodes differ, suggesting different graph layouts. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
