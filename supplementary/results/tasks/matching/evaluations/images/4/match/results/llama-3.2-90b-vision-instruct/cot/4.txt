**Graph Analysis and Comparison**

**Step 1: Node Count and Label Comparison**

*   Graph 1 has 3 nodes labeled 0, 1, and 3.
*   Graph 2 has 3 nodes labeled 0, 1, and 3.

Both graphs have the same number of nodes with identical labels. Therefore, the node counts and labels match.

**Step 2: Edge Comparison**

*   Graph 1 has two edges: (0, 3) and (1, 0).
*   Graph 2 has two edges: (0, 1) and (3, 2).

The edges in Graph 1 and Graph 2 are different. Graph 1's edges do not match Graph 2's edges.

**Conclusion**

Since the edges do not align between the two graphs, they do not match.
