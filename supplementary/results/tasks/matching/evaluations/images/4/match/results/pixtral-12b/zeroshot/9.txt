   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match each other. In Graph 1, there are two separate triangles with nodes (1, 2, 3) and (3, 4, 5). However, in Graph 2, the nodes are (1, 3, 4) with a different layout. The structure, arrangement, and nodes are different between the two graphs. Therefore, they do not represent the same graph."
}
```

Explanation:
- In Graph 1, the nodes (1, 2, 3) form one set of connections, while the nodes (3, 4, 5) form another set, making two distinct triangles.
- In Graph 2, the nodes are (1, 3, 4), arranged differently and all connected in a less dispersed manner.
- The connections and nodes between the two graphs are different, resulting in different layouts and hence they do not match.
