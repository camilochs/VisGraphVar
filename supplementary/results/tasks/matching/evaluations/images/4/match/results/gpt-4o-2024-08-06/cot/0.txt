    "analysis": "Step 1: Compare the number of nodes in both graphs. Graph 1 has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3 and Graph 2 also has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3.\nStep 2: Compare the edges between the nodes. Graph 1 has the edges (0-1), (0-2), (0-3), and (1-3). Graph 2 has the same set of edges: (0-1), (0-2), (0-3), and (1-3).\nStep 3: Check for weights on the edges. Both graphs do not list specific weights on the edges, implying all edges are equal/default.\nConclusion: All components (nodes and edges) match between the graphs, so the graphs are equivalent."
