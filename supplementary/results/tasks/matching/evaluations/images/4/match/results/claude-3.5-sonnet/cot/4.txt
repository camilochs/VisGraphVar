Edge Analysis:\n   - Graph 1: Has two edges forming a linear path (3-1-0), with node 2 isolated\n   - Graph 2: Has two edges forming a linear path (3-1-0), with node 2 isolated\n   However, the structure is different:\n   - Graph 1: Horizontal arrangement with blue nodes\n   - Graph 2: Vertical arrangement with green nodes and orange edges\n4. Final Decision: While the graphs contain the same elements (4 nodes, 2 edges), their spatial arrangement and visual properties (colors, orientation) are different, making them non-matching graphs."
