Node counts:\n   - Graph 1 has 2 nodes.\n   - Graph 2 has 4 nodes.\n   These node counts already indicate that the graphs do not match.\n2. Nodes and labels:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes with labels 0 and 1.\n   - Graph 2 has nodes with labels 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n   The labels are different, indicating that the structure is not the same.\n3. Edges:\n   - Graph 1 has one edge from node 0 to node 1 with no weight mentioned.\n   - Graph 2 has two edges: one from node 0 to node 1 and one from node 1 to node 3.\n   The number and arrangement of edges do not match.\n4. Node positions:\n   - Graph 1 has distinct positions of nodes 0 and 1.\n   - Graph 2 has distinct and additional positions from Graph 1, placing nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 differently.\n   The positions do not align.\n\nGiven the differences in node counts, labels, edges, and positions, the graphs do not match."
