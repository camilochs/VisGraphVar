   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The first graph (Graph 1) contains five nodes with varying connections.Nodes 0, 1, 4, and 2 are interconnected. Node 5 is also linked but to only one of these nodes (node 2). The second graph (Graph 2) features a different node arrangement with fewer nodes and fewer connections. It includes nodes like 8, 0, 5, 1, and 2, with a slightly different connectivity and no node equivalent to node 3 from the first graph. Therefore, these differences indicate that the graphs do not match."
