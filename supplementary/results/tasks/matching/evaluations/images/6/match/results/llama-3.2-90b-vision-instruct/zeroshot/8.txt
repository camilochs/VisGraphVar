The provided images depict two distinct graph types: **Graph 1** appears to be a directed graph, whereas **Graph 2** is undirected. Despite sharing the same node set, these graphs exhibit substantial differences in terms of their edges, edge directions (for Graph 1), and the absence of weights (edges in both graphs lack numbers). This analysis, while limited by its depth, reveals different structural properties between the two graph representations.

*Answer:* JSON Response:

   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Graph 1 appears to be directed while Graph 2 is undirected, with both lacking weights yet exhibiting significant differences in their edges and edge orientations (if present)."
