Node Counts and Labels:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n   - Missing node labels: Graph 1 has node 4, Graph 2 misses it.\n2. Edges:\n   - In Graph 1, node 1 connects to node 0, node 3 to node 6, node 5 to node 2, and node 5 to node 4.\n   - In Graph 2, node 4 connects to node 6, node 3 connects to node 6, node 5 connects to node 2, and node 1 connects to node 3.\n   - Edge difference: Graph 1 has an additional edge between 3 and 5 that is not present in Graph 2; Graph 2 has an additional edge between node 1 and node 3 that is not present in Graph 1.\nConclusion: Since there are differences in the node presence and connections, the graphs do not match."
