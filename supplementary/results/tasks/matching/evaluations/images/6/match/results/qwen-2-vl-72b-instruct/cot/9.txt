   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Upon comparing each component of the graphs, we find that they do not match. The node counts and labels are the same, but the connections or edges do not align. In Graph 1, there is a direct connection between node 0 and node 2, node 4, and node 3. In contrast, Graph 2 has connections between node 0 and node 4, node 2, and node 1. This discrepancy in connections leads to the conclusion that the graphs do not match."
