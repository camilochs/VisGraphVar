Edges:\n   - Graph 1 connections: (0-1), (1-4), (1-2), (1-5), (2-5), (4-3)\n   - Graph 2 connections: (0-1), (1-4), (1-2), (1-5), (2-5), (4-3)\n4. Edge Comparison: Each connection in Graph 1 has a corresponding connection in Graph 2. No weights are given, so this does not affect the comparison.\n5. Conclusion: Since both the nodes and their connections align perfectly, the graphs do match."
