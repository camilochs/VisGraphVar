   "analysis": "Comparing the two graphs, we can see that they have different structures. In Graph 1, there are 6 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. In Graph 2, there are also 6 nodes, but the labels are not aligned with the labels in Graph 1. For example, node 2 in Graph 1 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4, while node 2 in Graph 2 is only connected to node 5. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
