Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0 to 5 with connections that form multiple triangles and involve varying node connections compared to Graph 2. Graph 1 shows a more complex network with more interconnecting lines, whereas Graph 2 is more simplified with distinct triangular and quadrilateral formations. Additionally, the color coding and appearance are different, with Graph 1 using blue tones and Graph 2 using green tones."
