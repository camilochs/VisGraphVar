The graph in Graph 1 can be converted to an adjacency list representation as follows:

adjacency_list_1 = {

    0:[1, 5]

    1:[0, 2, 4]

    2:[1, 3]

    3:[2, 4]

    4:[1, 3], 

    5:[0]
}

The graph in Graph 2 can be converted to an adjacency list representation as follows:

adjacency_list_2 = {

  0:[2, 5]
  
  1:[3, 5]
  
  2:[0, 4]
  
  3:[1, 4]
  
  4:[2, 3]
  
  5:[0, 1]
}

After converting the two graphs to adjacency list representations, we can compare them for matching node connections, weights, and structures. The comparison reveals the following:

*   In Graph 1, node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. This doesn't align with the structure of Graph 2.
*   In Graph 1, node 5 is connected to nodes 0, while in Graph 2, it is connected to nodes 0 and 1. The extra connection indicates a difference in structure.
*   No weight information is provided for the graph vertices, so we're unable to draw conclusions about these.

Given the mismatches in node connections and the lack of information about weights on the graph vertices, we can conclude that the graphs do not match.
