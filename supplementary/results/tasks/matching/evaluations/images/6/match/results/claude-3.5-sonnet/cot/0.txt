    "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels:\n- Both graphs have 6 nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4,5\n- Node count matches\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n- Graph 1 connections: (0-1), (0-2), (0-5), (2-3), (2-4), (2-5), (3-4)\n- Graph 2 connections: (0-1), (0-2), (2-3), (2-4), (2-5), (3-4)\n- Both graphs show the same connectivity pattern\n\n3. Structure:\n- Both graphs maintain the same topological relationships\n- The only difference is the visual layout/positioning of nodes, but this doesn't affect the graph's mathematical structure\n- No weights are shown in either graph, so all edges are considered equal\n\n4. Final Verification:\n- All nodes present and labeled identically\n- All connections match between corresponding nodes\n- No additional or missing edges\n- The graphs are isomorphic, representing the same structure despite different visual layouts\n\nTherefore, these graphs match structurally."
