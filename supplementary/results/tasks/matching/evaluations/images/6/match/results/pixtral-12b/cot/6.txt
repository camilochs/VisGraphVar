Node Labels:\n   - Both graphs have nodes labeled 0 through 5.\n\n3. Nodes and Edges:\n   - Graph 1:\n     - Node 0 is connected to node 5.\n     - Node 5 is connected to node 1.\n     - Node 1 is connected to node 2.\n     - Node 2 is connected to node 4.\n     - Node 4 is connected to node 3.\n     - Node 1 is connected to node 3.\n   - Graph 2:\n     - Node 0 is connected to node 1.\n     - Node 1 is connected to node 2.\n     - Node 2 is connected to node 3.\n     - Node 3 is connected to node 0.\n     - Node 2 is connected to node 4.\n     - Node 4 is connected to node 0.\n\n4. Edge Comparison:\n   - The arrangement and labels of the connections (edges) between nodes are different.\n     - Examples: In Graph 1, node 1 connects to node 2, while in Graph 2, node 0 connects to node 1.\n     - The structure breaks down at various points (e.g., node 1 connection patterns).\n\nConclusion: Since the edge connections and overall graph structure are different, the graphs do not match."
