    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "Both graphs contain the same structure with 6 nodes (labeled 0-5) and identical connectivity patterns. While the layouts appear different visually (Graph 1 is arranged in a more spread-out manner while Graph 2 is more compact), the underlying connections between nodes are the same. Each node maintains the same relationships with other nodes across both graphs - for example, node 2 connects to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5 in both graphs. The only difference is the visual presentation, not the actual graph structure."
