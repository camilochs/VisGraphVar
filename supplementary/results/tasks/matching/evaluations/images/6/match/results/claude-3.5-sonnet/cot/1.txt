   "analysis": "1. Node count comparison:\n   - Both graphs have 6 nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4,5\n   - Node labels are identical in both graphs\n\n2. Edge comparison:\n   - Both graphs have identical connections:\n     * 0 connects to 1,2,3\n     * 1 connects to 0,4\n     * 2 connects to 0,3,5\n     * 3 connects to 0,2,5\n     * 4 connects to 1\n     * 5 connects to 2,3\n\n3. Structure comparison:\n   - The layout appears different (Graph 1 is arranged vertically, Graph 2 is more circular)\n   - However, topological structure is identical\n   - Edge weights are not shown in either graph, so assumed to be unweighted\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   Despite different visual layouts, both graphs are isomorphic with identical nodes, connections, and structure, therefore they match."
