    "analysis": "While both graphs contain the same nodes (0,1,2,3,4,5), their structures are different. In Graph 1, the nodes are disconnected from each other, appearing as isolated vertices. In Graph 2, there are three connected components: nodes 2-3-5 form a vertical line, nodes 1-0 are connected vertically, and node 4 stands alone. The presence of edges in Graph 2 versus the complete absence of edges in Graph 1 makes these graphs structurally different."
