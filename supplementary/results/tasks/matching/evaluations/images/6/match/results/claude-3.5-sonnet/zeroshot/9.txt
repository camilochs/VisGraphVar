    "analysis": "The two graphs are isomorphic, meaning they have the same structure despite different layouts. Both graphs contain 6 nodes (labeled 0-5) and 5 edges. The connectivity pattern is identical: node 0 is central with three branches - one leading to node 1, another through node 2 to node 4, and a third through node 3 to node 5. While Graph 1 uses a different spatial arrangement and blue coloring compared to Graph 2's green coloring, the underlying structure and connections are exactly the same."
