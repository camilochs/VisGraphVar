The first graph (Graph 1) has a tree structure with six nodes connected in a branching manner, whereas the second graph (Graph 2) has a three-star structure with five nodes connected in a hub-and-spokes arrangement. The vertex labels do not correspond between the two graphs and the layout and shape of the connections are significantly different."
