Based on the provided images of the two graphs, the following observations can be made with respect to each graph structure and their nodes:

*   Both graphs are directed graphs, which implies an inherent direction from one node to another.
*   Graph 1 starts with node 1 and points to the node 0. Beyond, it connects to nodes 3, 2, and then 5, ending at 4.
*   Graph 2 also starts with node 4 point to the node 2 and then to 0. The ongoing connection points to the  nodes 3 and 5, ending at 1.

To answer whether the two graphs matched simply or not on the provided diagrams:

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Graph 1 starts at node 1 whereas Graph 2 starts with 4. They, thus, do not have identical structures despite similar connections where edge between node 1 and 0 is present in both of graphs."
}
