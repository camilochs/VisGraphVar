Node count and labels:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - Both graphs seem to have the same node labels.\n2. Connection comparison:\n   - Graph 1 has a connection from 0 to 1, 0 to 2, 0 to 4, 3 to 2, 5 to 2 and 5 to 3.\n   - Graph 2 also has a connection from 0 to 1, 0 to 2, 0 to 4, 2 to 3 and 5, but visualize as yellow/orange lines.\n   - After assessing the node connections:\n      - Connections from 0 to 1, 0 to 2, and 0 to 4 match in both graphs.\n      - Connections from 3 to 2 and 5 to 3 do not exist in Graph 2; instead, Graph 2 has those nodes organized differently.\n   - Therefore, the visual edges and their organization differ, leading to a definitive conclusion that the graphs do not match."
