   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels:\n- Both graphs have 6 nodes\n- Both graphs use labels 0,1,2,3,4,5\n\n2. Edge Connections:\n- Node 3 connects to Node 4 in both graphs\n- Node 4 connects to Nodes 1 and 2 in both graphs\n- Node 1 connects to Nodes 0 and 5 in both graphs\n- Node 2 connects to Node 5 in both graphs\n- Node 0 connects to Node 5 in both graphs\n\n3. Graph Structure:\n- While the layouts appear different (Graph 1 uses grey edges and Graph 2 uses orange/yellow edges), the underlying connectivity structure is identical\n- Both graphs are undirected\n- No weights are shown in either graph\n\n4. Conclusion:\nThe graphs match structurally despite their different visual presentations. All nodes have the same connections and form the same topology."
