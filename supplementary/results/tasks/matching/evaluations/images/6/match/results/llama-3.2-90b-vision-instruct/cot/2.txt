**Step-by-Step Analysis**

### Node Comparison

* **Node Count**: Graph 1 contains 5 nodes, while Graph 2 also has 5 nodes, identifying an equivalent node count.
* **Node Labels**: Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0 through 4; Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0 through 4, encompassing matching node labels.

### Edge Comparison

* **Edge Count**: Graph 1 has 6 edges; Graph 2 also has 6 edges, defining an equivalent edge count.
* **Edge Connections**:
	+ Graph 1: 0-1, 0-3, 0-4, 1-2, 2-3, 3-5
	+ Graph 2: 0-1, 0-4, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5

**Comparing Directed Connections**

* Both graphs consist solely of directed connections, affirming they are of the same type.

**Conclusion**

Given the equal number of nodes, identical node labels, and equivalent edge count with matching connections, but differing source and destination nodes for each edge, and considering the directed nature of both graphs, Graph 1 does not exactly match Graph 2.

**JSON Response**
