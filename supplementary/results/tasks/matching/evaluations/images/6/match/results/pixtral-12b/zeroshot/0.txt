   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match. They have the same number of nodes (6 nodes each), but the structure and connections between the nodes differ significantly. In Graph 1, nodes have connections creating multiple clusters with different levels of interconnections, while in Graph 2, nodes appear to form more distinct and grouped connections with fewer intermediate connections. The visual representation and configuration are notably different."
