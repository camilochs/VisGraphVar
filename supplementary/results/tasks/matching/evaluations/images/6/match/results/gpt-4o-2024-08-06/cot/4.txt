   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Step 1: Node Count - Graph 1 has 6 nodes labeled 0-5, and Graph 2 also has 6 nodes labeled 0-5. Step 2: Node Labels - Both graphs have the same node labels from 0 to 5. Step 3: Edges - Graph 1 has edges (0-1) and (2-5), but Graph 2 has edges (0-1), (2-5), and (3-5). Step 4: Edge Weights - No weights are evident on Graph 1, while Graph 2 displays colored edges which might imply additional attributes like weights. Conclusion: The graphs do not match due to the difference in edges between nodes 3 and 5."
