    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "Both graphs have identical structure with 6 nodes (labeled 0-5) and the same connection patterns. The graphs show nodes 4-1-0-2-5 forming a path, with node 3 connected to nodes 0 and 2, creating a triangular structure at the top. While the graphs are drawn with different layouts and colors (blue vs green), their underlying topology and connectivity are exactly the same."
