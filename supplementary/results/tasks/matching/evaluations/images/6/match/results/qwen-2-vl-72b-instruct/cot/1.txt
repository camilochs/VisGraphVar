   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Upon comparing each component of the two graphs, we find that they do not match exactly. The following points highlight the discrepancies:\n\n1. Node Counts and Labels: Both graphs have the same number of nodes (6) and the same labels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n2. Connections or Edges: The connections between nodes differ. Specifically, there are differences in the connections for node 0 and nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n- In Graph 1, node 0 connects to node 1, and node 5 connects to node 0 and node 3.\n- In Graph 2, node 0 does not connect to node 1, and the connections for nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are different from Graph 1.\n\nTherefore, the two graphs do not match due to differences in the connections between nodes."
