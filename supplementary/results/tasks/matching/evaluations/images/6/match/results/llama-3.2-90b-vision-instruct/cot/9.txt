**Graph Comparison Analysis**

To determine if the two graphs match, we will analyze each component step by step.

**Step 1: Node Count Comparison**
Graph 1 has 5 nodes, and Graph 2 also has 5 nodes. The node counts are equal.

**Step 2: Node Label Comparison**
Node labels in Graph 1: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Node labels in Graph 2: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
The node labels do not match exactly. Although most labels are identical, Graph 2 has a label '5' instead of '4'.

**Step 3: Edge Comparison**
Edges in Graph 1:
- (0, 1)
- (0, 2)
- (0, 3)
- (1, 4)
Edges in Graph 2:
- (0, 1)
- (0, 2)
- (0, 3)
- (4, 2)
The edges do not match. Graph 2 has an edge between nodes 4 and 2, which does not exist in Graph 1. Additionally, the edge (1, 4) in Graph 1 is not present in Graph 2.

**Conclusion**
Based on the comparison of node counts, labels, and edges, the two graphs do not match due to differences in node labels and edge connections.
