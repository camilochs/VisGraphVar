    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "Both graphs have identical structure with 6 nodes (labeled 0-5) and the same connection patterns. While the graphs have different visual layouts and colors (blue vs green), their underlying topology is the same. Each graph shows the same connectivity where node 3 connects to 4, node 4 connects to 1 and 2, node 1 connects to 0 and 5, and node 2 connects to 5. The number of edges and their connections between nodes are preserved in both graphs."
