**Step-by-Step Analysis**

1. **Node Comparison**: Both graphs have 5 nodes, labeled 0 through 4. However, the labels are not in the same positions due to the difference in node orders.

2. **Edge Connection Comparison**:

* Graph 1: Node 0 connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5; node 3 connects to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
* Graph 2: Node 0 connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5; node 3 connects to nodes 2 and 4.

Based on this comparison, we see distinct differences in the connections and total number of connections. When we compare the graphs, we do not find a 5 node in Graph 2.

3. **Weight Comparison**: All edges are unweighted.

**Conclusion**: Despite having the same number of nodes, the nodes are positioned differently, and the connections and their labels differ between the graphs, preventing a perfect match.
