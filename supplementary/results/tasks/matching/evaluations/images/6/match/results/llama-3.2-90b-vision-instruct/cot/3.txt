**Graph Comparison Analysis**

*   **Step 1: Compare Node Counts**
    *   Graph 1: The node count is 5.
    *   Graph 2: The node count is 5.
    *   Since both node counts are equal (5), this is a match.

*   **Step 2: Compare Node Labels**
    *   Graph 1: The node labels are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    *   Graph 2: The node labels are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    *   Each label in Graph1 is present in Graph2 and vice versa. All labels match, indicating a match.

*   **Step 3: Compare Connections**
    *   Graph 1: There are unweighted connections between 4-5 and 2-5.
    *   Graph 2: There are unweighted connections between 4-5 and 2-5.
    *   Since both connections are equal (4-5 and 2-5 are present in both graphs), this is a match.

**Conclusion:**

Since all three conditions are met, the graphs match.
