   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match. Here's the step-by-step comparison:\n\n1. Node counts and labels:\n   - Both graphs have 6 nodes each, and the labels match (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\n2. Connections or edges:\n   - Analyzing the edges, we can see that the connections in Graph 2 do not match the connections in Graph 1. For example, in Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 5, but in Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 5.\n\nSince the connections do not match, the graphs are not identical."
