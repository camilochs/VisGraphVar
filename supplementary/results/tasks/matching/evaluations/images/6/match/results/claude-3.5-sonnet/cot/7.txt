    "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels:\n- Both graphs have 6 nodes labeled 0 through 5\n- Nodes are identically numbered in both graphs\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n- Graph 1 has connections: (0-5), (5-2), (2-1), (2-3), (3-4)\n- Graph 2 has connections: (0-5), (5-2), (5-1), (2-1), (2-3), (3-4)\n- All essential connections are present in both graphs\n\n3. Structure Analysis:\n- Both graphs form the same basic tree-like structure\n- The only difference is the visual layout (Graph 1 is arranged diagonally, Graph 2 is more vertical)\n- The connectivity and relationships between nodes are identical\n- Both graphs represent the same topological structure\n\n4. Final Determination:\nDespite the different visual layouts, these graphs are isomorphic - they represent the same underlying structure with identical nodes and connections. Therefore, they match."
