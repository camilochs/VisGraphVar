**Graph Comparison Analysis**

**Step 1: Node Count Comparison**

* Graph 1: 5 nodes
* Graph 2: 5 nodes

**Step 2: Node Label Comparison**

* Graph 1: Node labels: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
* Graph 2: Node labels: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

All node labels match between the two graphs.

**Step 3: Connection (Edge) Comparison**

* Graph 1: Edges with weights: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 3)]
* Graph 2: Edges with weights: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 3)]

All edges and their corresponding weights match between the two graphs.

**Conclusion**

Based on the comparison of node counts, labels, and edges with their weights, the two graphs are identical.
