**Step 1: Analyze the structure of each graph.**

Graph 1:
- The graph has 6 nodes labeled from 0 to 5.
- The nodes 0 and 5 are connected.
- Node 0 is also connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to node 1.
- There's a direct connection between nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to both nodes 4 and 3.

Graph 2:
- This graph also contains 6 nodes labeled from 0 to 5.
- Similar connections exist: nodes 0 and 5 are connected, 0 to 3, 5 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to both 4 and 3.

**Step 2: Identify any weights or labels on the edges and nodes.**

Both graphs do not display explicit weights on their edges, but the presence of numbers on the nodes suggests potential weights or identifiers for the nodes themselves.

**Step 3: Compare the structures and weights (if any) for a match.**

Given the visual representation, both graphs appear to have the same node connections and numbers associated with the nodes. However, without clear indication of weights on the edges, we focus on the structural similarity and the nodal values.

**Conclusion:**

Given the structural matches and the absence of clear edge weights causing discrepancies, the graphs are considered to match based on their structural and nodal attributes.
