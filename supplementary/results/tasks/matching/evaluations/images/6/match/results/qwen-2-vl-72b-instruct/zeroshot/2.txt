Graph 1 has a node labeled '4' connected to nodes '2' and '0', while in Graph 2, the node labeled '4' is connected to nodes '2' and '0' with a different layout. Additionally, the connections between nodes in Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match. For example, in Graph 1, node '1' is connected to nodes '0', '2', and '3', whereas in Graph 2, node '1' is connected to nodes '0', '5', and '3'."
