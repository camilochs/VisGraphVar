To determine if two graph images match, you would need to compare their structures, node connections, and any weights if present.

### Step 1: Convert Images to Data

Read in the images as graphs and make a note of their nodes, edges, and weights if present.

For example, suppose one of the graphs is `graph_1` with five nodes and six edges (with directions and weights).

The image will be encoded as:

```json
{
   "nodes": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
   "edges": [
       {"source": 1, "target": 0, "weight": 0.5},
       {"source": 2, "target": 0, "weight": 1},
       {"source": 3, "target": 0, "weight": 0},
       {"source": 5, "target": 1, "weight": 0.5},
       {"source": 5, "target": 2, "weight": 0},
       {"source": 5, "target": 4, "weight": 1}
   ],
}
```

And suppose the second graph is `graph_2` with six nodes and five edges (with directions and weights).

The image will be represented as:

```json
{
   "nodes": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
   "edges": [
       {"source": 5, "target": 1, "weight": 0.5},
       {"source": 5, "target": 3, "weight": 1},
       {"source": 5, "target": 5, "weight": 1},
       {"source": 5, "target": 3, "weight": 1},
       {"source": 5, "target": 2, "weight": 0}
   ]
   }
```

### Step 2: Compare Data

Compare the data structures you have created of the two graphs. We see that the same number of nodes is not present in `graph_1` and `graph_2`. Thus, the two graphs do not match in structure. However, we notice that certain edges and nodes are present in both graphs. 

Although they have some nodes and connections in common, since the edge counts and graph structure are not equal we consider them non-matching.

This comparison can be summarized in JSON as follows:

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Since the numbers of both nodes and edges and graph structure are the same, we consider the two graphs non-matching."
}
```

### Final Answer:

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Since the numbers of both nodes and edges and graph structure are the same, we consider the two graphs non-matching."
}
```
