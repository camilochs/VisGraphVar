To determine if the two graphs match, we will compare each component of the graphs. 

First, let's compare the number of nodes. Graph 1 has 5 nodes labeled from 0 to 4. Graph 2 also has 5 nodes labeled from 0 to 4. 

Next, let's examine the connections or edges between the nodes. In Graph 1, there is an edge between nodes 0 and 4, an edge between nodes 0 and 5, an edge between nodes 3 and 4, an edge between nodes 3 and 5, and an edge between nodes 1 and 5. In Graph 2, there is an edge between nodes 0 and 4, an edge between nodes 0 and 5, an edge between nodes 3 and 4, an edge between nodes 3 and 5, and an edge between nodes 1 and 5. Since the edges are the same in both graphs, these components also match.

Based on this analysis, all elements align, so the two graphs match.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "After comparing the node counts and labels, as well as each connection or edge including any weights, it was found that the two graphs have the same number of nodes (5), the same labels for each node (0-4), and identical connections or edges. Based on this step-by-step comparison, all components align, resulting in a match between the two graphs."
