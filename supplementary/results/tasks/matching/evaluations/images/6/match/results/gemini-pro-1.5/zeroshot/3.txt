  "analysis": "While both graphs have the same number of nodes (6), their connectivity differs. Graph 1 is a single connected component with edges like (0, 5), (5, 2), (0, 4), and (1, 4), forming a somewhat irregular structure. Node 3 is isolated. Graph 2 consists of two separate connected components: one isolated node (3) and a larger component with a distinct connectivity pattern where nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 2 are connected differently than in Graph 1.  For example, in Graph 2, there are edges like (0, 5), (0, 1), and (4, 2), which are not present in Graph 1 in the same configuration."
