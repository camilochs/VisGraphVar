Edge Analysis:\n- Node 2 connects to Node 1 in both graphs\n- Node 1 connects to Node 3 in both graphs\n- Node 3 connects to Node 4 in both graphs\n- Node 3 connects to Node 5 in both graphs\n- Node 3 connects to Node 0 in both graphs\n- Node 4 connects to Node 0 in both graphs\n- Node 4 connects to Node 5 in both graphs\n- Node 0 connects to Node 5 in both graphs\n\n3. Overall Structure:\n- Both graphs show identical topology\n- The only difference is visual presentation (blue vs green nodes and gray vs orange edges)\n- No weights are shown in either graph\n\n4. Decision: The graphs are structurally identical with the same nodes and connections, just displayed with different colors."
