   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels Check:\n   - Both graphs have 6 nodes labeled 0-5\n   - Node count matches: 6 in each graph\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n   - Graph 1 has edges: (4-2), (2-3), (3-1), (1-5), (1-0), (0-4)\n   - Graph 2 has edges: (4-2), (2-3), (3-1), (1-5), (1-0), (0-4)\n   - All edges connect the same node pairs in both graphs\n\n3. Graph Structure:\n   - Both graphs form the same topological structure\n   - The only difference is the layout/visualization, with Graph 1 having a more spread-out arrangement compared to Graph 2\n   - The underlying connectivity remains identical\n\n4. Additional Properties:\n   - Neither graph has weighted edges\n   - Both are undirected graphs\n   - Both graphs have the same number of edges\n\nConclusion: The graphs match exactly in terms of nodes, edges, and overall structure. The only difference is their visual layout, which doesn't affect their mathematical equivalence."
