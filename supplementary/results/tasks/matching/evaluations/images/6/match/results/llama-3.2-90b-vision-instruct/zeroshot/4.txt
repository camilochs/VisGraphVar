**Step 1: Identify Key Graph Components**

| Graph | Nodes | Connections |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Graph 1 | 5 (0-4) | 4 |
| Graph 2 | 6 (0-5) | 5 |

**Step 2: Compare the Number of Nodes**

Graph 1 has 5 nodes, and Graph 2 has 6 nodes. These graphs have a different number of nodes.

**Step 3: Analyze the Node Match**

Get the corresponding unique nodes number from given graphs.

| Graphs | Unique Id |
| --- | --- |
| Graphs 1 & 2  All | [0, 5, 2, 4, 3] |

Based on the previous analysis, the data regarding the graph were checked in line with the conditions. It does not match.

**Step 4: Reason Behind it Does not Match**

The node connections are different, and there is one more node in Graph 2 than Graph 1. These factors imply that since some nodes are not connected equally in the graphs, and there is an extra node information of Graph 2 compared to Graph 1, the input images cannot represent the same graph.



**Final Answer:**

There is no match between the graphs. It is based on  the number of nodes present and the connectivity of the edges according to the expected format.



Answer to the problem:

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Difference of node connections and presence of extra node of image 2 of shown graphs."
}
