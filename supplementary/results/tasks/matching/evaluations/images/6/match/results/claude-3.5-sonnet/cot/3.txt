   "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels: Both graphs have 6 nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4,5\n2. Node Positioning:\n   - Node 3 is isolated in both graphs\n   - Nodes 0,1,2,4,5 form the same connected component in both graphs\n3. Edge Connections:\n   - Node 4 connects to nodes 0,1,2,5\n   - Node 0 connects to nodes 1,4,5\n   - Node 2 connects to nodes 4,5\n   - Node 1 connects to nodes 0,4\n   - Node 5 connects to nodes 0,2,4\n   - Node 3 has no connections\n4. Overall Structure:\n   - Both graphs contain identical components\n   - The layout is different but topologically equivalent\n   - All connections match exactly between the two graphs\nConclusion: The graphs are isomorphic, containing the same nodes and connections, just arranged differently visually."
