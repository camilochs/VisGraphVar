   "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 6 nodes (labeled 0-5), so this matches.\n\n2. Node Connectivity Analysis:\n- Graph 1: Node 0 connects to nodes 1, 2, and 3\n- Graph 2: Node 0 connects to nodes 1, 2, and 3\nHowever, the overall structure differs:\n\n3. Structure Differences:\n- Graph 1 has a tree-like structure with node 0 as root, node 2 connecting to 4, and node 3 connecting to 5\n- Graph 2 has a star-like structure with node 0 as center, and forms a different path: 4-2-0-1 and 0-3-5\n\n4. Edge Pattern:\n- Graph 1 forms path: 4-2-0-1 and 0-3-5\n- Graph 2 forms different paths with node 0 as central hub\n\nConclusion: While both graphs have the same number of nodes and similar node labels, their structural arrangements and edge connections are different, making them non-matching graphs."
