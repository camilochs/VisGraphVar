    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "The two graphs are structurally identical. Both graphs contain 6 nodes (labeled 0-5) with the same connection pattern. Each graph shows a branching structure where node 2 acts as a central point connecting to nodes 1, 3, and 5. Node 3 connects to node 4, and node 5 connects to node 0. The only visual difference is the layout orientation (one is diagonal while the other is more vertical) and the edge colors, but structurally they represent the same graph."
