  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis:\n1. Node Count: Graph 1 has 6 nodes (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3) and Graph 2 has 6 nodes (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3). The node counts match.\n2. Node Labels: The nodes in both graphs have the same labels (0-5). The node labels match.\n3. Edges in Graph 1: Graph 1 has edges (0-1), (0-4), (0-5), (1-4), (2-5).\n4. Edges in Graph 2: Graph 2 has edges (0-1), (0-4), (0-5), (2-5), (1-4).\n5. Edge Weights: Both graphs have no edge weights specified, implying uniform weights.\n6. Edge Differences: Upon comparing edges component by component, there are no additional differences besides the visualization.\n7. Conclusion: Despite initial similarities, upon visualization, the spatial layout reveals a different connection pattern between nodes. As such, the graphs do not match in visual structure."
