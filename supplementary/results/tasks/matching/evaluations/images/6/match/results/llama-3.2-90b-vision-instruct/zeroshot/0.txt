**Analysis of Graph Structures**

To determine if Graph 1 and Graph 2 match, we need to compare their structures, node connections, and weights.

**Graph 1:**

* Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* Edges:
	+ (0, 1)
	+ (0, 2)
	+ (0, 4)
	+ (1, 3)
	+ (2, 3)
	+ (3, 4)
	+ (4, 5)

**Graph 2:**

* Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* Edges:
	+ (0, 1)
	+ (0, 2)
	+ (0, 5)
	+ (1, 4)
	+ (2, 3)
	+ (3, 4)
	+ (4, 5)

**Comparison:**

Upon examination, it is clear that Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not have the same structure or node connections. While both graphs have the same number of nodes, the edges differ significantly between the two.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The graphs have different edge connections, indicating they are not structurally identical."
}
