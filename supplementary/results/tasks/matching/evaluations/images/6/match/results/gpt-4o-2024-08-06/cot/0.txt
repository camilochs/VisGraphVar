Edges: Both graphs have the following edges: (0,1), (0,2), (0,5), (2,3), (2,4), and (3,5). Although the layout is different, the connections between nodes are the same.\n4. Edge Weights: There are no weights visible on the edges, indicating they are likely unweighted or carry identical weights.\nConclusion: All components match, so the graphs are the same."
