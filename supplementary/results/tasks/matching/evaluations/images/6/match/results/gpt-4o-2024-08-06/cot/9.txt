   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "1. Node count: Both graphs have six nodes, labeled 0 to 5, indicating a possible match in nodes.\n2. Node labels: In both graphs, the nodes are labeled identically (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), confirming node labeling matches.\n3. Edges: Upon evaluation, both graphs have the same connections: (0-1), (0-2), (0-3), (2-4), (3-5). The edges are unweighted which implies no weights to compare.\n4. Conclusion: As all nodes match in count and label, and the edges are identical, the graphs match."
