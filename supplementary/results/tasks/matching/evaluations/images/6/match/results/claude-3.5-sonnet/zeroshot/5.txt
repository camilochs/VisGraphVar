   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "Both graphs have identical structure and connectivity. They contain 6 nodes (labeled 0-5) with the same exact connections: nodes 2-1-3 form a linear path, and nodes 3-4-0-5 form a complete subgraph where each node is connected to every other node in that group. The only difference is the visual styling (blue vs green nodes and gray vs orange edges), but the underlying graph structure is exactly the same."
