   "analysis": "Step-by-step explanation of each element compared and why the final decision was reached.\n1. First, compare the node counts.\n    - Graph 1 has 6 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n    - Graph 2 has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    Therefore, the node counts are different (Graph 1 has one additional node).\n\n2. Compare the node labels corresponding to each graph.\n    - Graph 1 has nodes 0 through 5.\n    - Graph 2 has nodes 0 through 4 and does not include 5.\n    Additionally, node 3 is labeled differently in terms of connection and position.\n    Therefore, the node labels do not fully match.\n\n3. Evaluate the connections or edges in each graph.\n    - Graph 1 has specific connections between nodes 0-4, 1-4, 2-4, and additional connections. These follow a detailed pattern.\n    - Graph 2 has connections between nodes 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 1-2, 1-4, 2-3, and 3-4, but this pattern is different.\n    Moreover, the edge weights and colors are different,\n    Therefore, the connection patterns and edge attributes do not match.\n   \n Since node counts, labels, and connections are different, the graphs do not match."
