**Step 1: Examine the nodes and connections in both graphs.**

The first graph has five nodes labeled $1$ through $4$, and a fifth node labeled $0$.

The second graph also has five nodes: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and a fifth node labeled $0$.

**Step 2: Check if the number of nodes matches.**

Both graphs have five nodes.

**Step 3: Compare the structures and node connections.**

In the first graph, the edges are {$(1, 4), (1, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)$}.

In the second graph, the edges are {$(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)$}.

Since none of the edges match and there are different start nodes and paths in both graphs, the two graphs are not identical.

**Conclusion:**

For the final answer, here is the JSON format message as requested:

```json
{
"match": "no",
"analysis": "The connections and edges between nodes don't match, so the graphs are different"    
}
