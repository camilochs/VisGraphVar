   "analysis": "The two graphs have different structures. Graph 1 has connections between nodes 0, 1, and 4, while Graph 2 has connections between nodes 0, 1, and 5. Additionally, the nodes in the fully connected subgraphs (nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5 in Graph 1 and nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5 in Graph 2) are not connected in the same way. Therefore, the two graphs do not match."
