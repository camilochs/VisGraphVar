  "analysis": "Both graphs have the same nodes, labeled 0 through 5. However, the connections between the nodes are different. In Graph 1, the edges are: (4, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1), (2, 5), (5, 0), (1, 5). In Graph 2, the edges are: (4, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1), (2, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1).  Because the edge (1,5) in Graph 1 is (5,1) in Graph 2, and both are undirected graphs, we can initially mistake them for isomorphic graphs. However, upon closer inspection, we see a structural difference that confirms they are not isomorphic. For instance, in Graph 2, nodes 1, 2, and 5 form a triangle, a structure absent in Graph 1. This difference in connectivity means the graphs are not the same."
