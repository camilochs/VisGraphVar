Edges:\n   - Graph 1 has edges: (0-5), (5-2), (2-4), (4-1), (1-3), (3-5).\n   - Graph 2 has edges: (0-5), (5-2), (2-4), (4-1), (1-3), (3-5).\n   - The edges and connections match in both graphs, with node permutations not affecting the overall structure.\n4. Edge Weights: Both graphs do not display any edge weights, indicating they are unweighted or identical. \n\nConclusion: Since both the node labels and connectivity (via edges) are identical, the graphs match in every required aspect."
