   "analysis": "The two graphs labeled as Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match. Graph 1 uses blue nodes to represent its vertices and connections, whereas Graph 2 uses green nodes with similar labels. Graph 1 contains an additional edge connecting nodes 5 and 1, which is absent in Graph 2. Additionally, the arrangement and structure of connections differ between the two graphs."
