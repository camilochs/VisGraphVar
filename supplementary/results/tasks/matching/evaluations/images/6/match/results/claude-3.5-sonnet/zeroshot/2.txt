   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "Both graphs contain the same structure with 6 nodes (labeled 0-5) and identical connectivity patterns. While the layouts and colors appear different (blue nodes in Graph 1, green nodes in Graph 2), the underlying graph structure is the same. All node connections match between the two graphs, including the connections between nodes 0-1, 1-5, 0-4, 1-3, 2-3, 2-4, and all other edges. The graphs are isomorphic, meaning they represent the same mathematical structure despite their different visual presentations."
