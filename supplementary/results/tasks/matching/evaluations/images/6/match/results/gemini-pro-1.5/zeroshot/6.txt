  "match": "yes",
  "analysis": "Both graphs have the same number of nodes (6) and the same connections between them. Graph 1 is visually different with respect to node placement, but the underlying structure is identical to Graph 2 after a rotation. Specifically, node 5 can be seen as the center node; it has connections to 0, 2 and 3. This pattern is preserved between both graphs."
