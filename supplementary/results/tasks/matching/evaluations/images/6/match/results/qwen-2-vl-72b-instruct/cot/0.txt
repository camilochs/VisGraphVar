   "analysis": "The nodes in Graph 1 are labeled 0 to 5, while the nodes in Graph 2 are labeled 0 to 5 as well. However, the connections between the nodes are different. For example, node 0 in Graph 1 is connected to node 1 and node 5, but in Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5. Similarly, node 2 in Graph 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5, but in Graph 2, node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
