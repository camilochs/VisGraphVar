   "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 5 nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4\n2. Node Labels: Both graphs contain identical node labels\n3. Edge Analysis:\n   - Both graphs have edge connecting nodes 3-5\n   - Both graphs have edge connecting nodes 5-2\n   - Both graphs have edge connecting nodes 1-0\n   - Node 4 is isolated in both graphs\n4. Graph Structure:\n   - Both graphs show two disconnected components:\n     * One component with nodes 3-5-2\n     * One component with nodes 1-0\n     * An isolated node 4\n5. Visual Layout: While the layouts appear different (one vertical vs one spread out), the topological structure is identical\n\nConclusion: The graphs match completely in terms of nodes, edges, and overall structure, despite different visual layouts."
