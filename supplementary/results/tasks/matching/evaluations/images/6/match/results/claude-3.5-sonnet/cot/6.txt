   "analysis": "1. Node Count & Labels:\n- Both graphs have 6 nodes each\n- Both graphs have nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4,5\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n- Both graphs have the same number of edges (6)\n- Graph 1 connections: 0-5, 5-2, 5-3, 3-1, 1-4, 2-4\n- Graph 2 connections: 0-5, 5-2, 5-3, 3-1, 1-4, 2-4\n\n3. Structure:\n- Both graphs form the same geometric shape\n- The node positions may appear different but the connectivity pattern is identical\n\n4. Conclusion:\n- Despite different visual layouts, both graphs are isomorphic with identical node labels and edge connections\n- Therefore, these graphs are mathematically equivalent and match."
