   "analysis": "Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match. Step-by-step explanation: 1. Node counts and labels: Both graphs have the same node counts and labels (nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). 2. Connectivity: The connections between nodes differ between the two graphs. Graph 1 has edges (0-1, 3-5, 5-2), while Graph 2 has edges (3-5, 5-2, 0-1). 3. Edge weights: The edge weights also differ. Graph 1 has edge weights that are not specified, while Graph 2 has edge weights of (3,5), (5,2), and (0,1). Therefore, due to the different connectivity and edge weights, the graphs do not match."
