Edge count and structure comparison:\n   - Graph 1 has 6 edges\n   - Graph 2 has 5 edges\n   - Graph 1 has a triangular structure between nodes 0,1,3\n   - Graph 2 has a more linear structure\n\n3. Connectivity differences:\n   - Graph 1: Node 5 connects to nodes 0,2,4\n   - Graph 2: Node 0 connects to nodes 1,3,5\n   - Overall connection patterns are very different\n\n4. Final determination: The graphs do not match because they have different numbers of edges and completely different connection patterns between nodes, even though they use the same node labels."
