   "analysis": "1. Node Count Comparison:\n- Both graphs have 6 nodes each (labeled 0-5)\n- MATCH on node count\n\n2. Node Connectivity Analysis:\n- Graph 1 has a triangular component (nodes 0,2,3 connected)\n- Graph 2 has a triangular component (nodes 1,3,4 connected)\n- Different node configurations in the triangles\n\n3. Isolated Nodes:\n- Graph 1 has isolated nodes: 1, 4, and 5\n- Graph 2 has isolated nodes: 0, 2, and 5\n- Different pattern of isolated nodes\n\n4. Overall Structure:\n- While both graphs have the same number of nodes and one connected component each, the structure and connectivity patterns are different\n- The triangular components involve different node numbers\n- The isolated nodes are different between the graphs\n\nConclusion: The graphs do not match due to different connectivity patterns and different arrangements of isolated nodes."
