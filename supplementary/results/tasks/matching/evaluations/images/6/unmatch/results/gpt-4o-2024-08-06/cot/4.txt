    "analysis": "Step 1: Node Count - Both graphs have 6 nodes; Graph 1 has nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Graph 2 has nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Step 2: Isolated Node - In Graph 1, node 2 is isolated, while in Graph 2, node 3 is isolated. Step 3: Node Labels - Node labels are the same in both graphs. Step 4: Edges Comparison - Graph 1 has edges (0-5), (3-5), (3-4), (3-1), while Graph 2 has edges (0-1), (0-5), (0-4), (4-5), (4-2). Step 5: Edge Weights - Edge weights are not specified. Conclusion: The node connectivity and edges differ between the graphs, hence they do not match."
