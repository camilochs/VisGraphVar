Comparing the connections:\n\n* **Graph 1:**\n    * 0 is connected to 1 and 2.\n    * 1 is connected to 0 and 2.\n    * 2 is connected to 0, 1, 3, and 4.\n    * 3 is connected to 2 and 5.\n    * 4 is connected to 2.\n    * 5 is connected to 3.\n\n* **Graph 2:**\n    * 0 is connected to 4.\n    * 1 is connected to 2 and 3.\n    * 2 is connected to 1 and 3.\n    * 3 is connected to 1, 2, 5, and indirectly to 4 through 0. This connection between 3 and 4 involves merging two edges, 0-4 and 0-3 \n    * 4 is connected to 0 and 3. . This connection between 3 and 4 involves merging two edges, 0-4 and 0-3\n    * 5 is connected to 3.\n\nAlthough visually different, the connections in both graphs are equivalent. Graph 2 represents a different layout of the same graph structure as Graph 1, and has combined the 3-2 and 3-1 edge by merging these two along with edges 0-3 and 0-4 into the edges 1-3-2 and 0-4-3 respectively. Therefore, the graphs match."
