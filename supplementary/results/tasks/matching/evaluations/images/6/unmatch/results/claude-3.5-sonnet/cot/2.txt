   "analysis": "1. Node Count Analysis:\n- Graph 1 has 7 nodes (labeled 0,1,2,3,4,5)\n- Graph 2 has 6 nodes (labeled 0,1,2,3,4,5)\nNode counts are actually different.\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n- Graph 1 shows a tree-like structure with node 0 as center, connecting to nodes 1,2,3\n- Graph 2 shows a different structure with node 1 as central point connecting to nodes 2,3,4\n\n3. Connection Pattern Analysis:\n- Graph 1: Nodes are connected in a centralized pattern around node 0\n- Graph 2: Nodes form a different pattern with sequential connections\n\n4. Layout Differences:\n- Graph 1 has isolated nodes (4,5)\n- Graph 2 has a different overall structure\n\nConclusion: The graphs do not match due to different node counts, different connection patterns, and different overall structures."
