   "analysis": "1. Node Count Comparison:\n- Graph 1 has 6 nodes (labeled 0,1,2,3,4,5)\n- Graph 2 has 7 nodes (labeled 0,1,2,3,4,5)\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n- Graph 1 has two separate components:\n  * A linear path of 4 nodes (4-5-3-0)\n  * A single edge connecting nodes 1-2\n- Graph 2 has two separate components:\n  * A linear path of 4 nodes (5-0-4-1)\n  * A single edge connecting nodes 2-3\n\n3. Structure Comparison:\n- While both graphs have two disconnected components, their structures differ\n- The connections between nodes are different\n- The relative positions and relationships between nodes do not match\n\n4. Conclusion:\nThe graphs do not match due to different node counts, different edge connections, and different overall structure of the components."
