Node Count and Labels:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n   - Both graphs have 6 nodes, but the labels do not match exactly.\n2. Edge Count and Connections:\n   - Graph 1 has a node 0 connected to 1, 2, and 3 with no edge weights.\n   - Graph 2 has a node 0 connected to 1 and 2 with no edge weights.\n   - The connections and weights do not match between the two graphs.\nConclusion:\nGiven the discrepancies in node labels and edge connections, the graphs do not match."
