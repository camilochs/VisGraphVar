Graph 1 (blue nodes):\n   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.\n   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.\n   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 3 (though not a part of the primary five, relevant to the connections).\n3. Graph 2 (green nodes):\n   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.\n   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.\n   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.\n   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.\n4. The connections between nodes differ significantly in content and structure.\n    By comparing the exact mappings of the lines and nodes edge by edge, it can be confirmed the connectivity and intermediary relationships described do not align across both graphs.\n5. Therefore, based on both the differing layouts and specific connection patterns, it is evident that the two graphs do not match."
