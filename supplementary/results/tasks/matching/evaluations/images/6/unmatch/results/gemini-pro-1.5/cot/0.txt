Comparing the edges:\n\nGraph 1:\n- 0 connected to 2 and 5\n- 1 connected to 3, 4, and 5\n- 2 connected to 0 and 1\n- 3 connected to 1\n- 4 connected to 1 and 5\n- 5 connected to 0, 1, and 4\n\nGraph 2:\n- 0 connected to 1, 2, and 5\n- 1 connected to 0 and 3\n- 2 connected to 0, 3, 4, and 5\n- 3 connected to 1 and 2\n- 4 connected to 2 and 5\n- 5 connected to 0, 2, and 4\n\nAfter relabeling the nodes in Graph 2 such that 0->1, 1->3, 2->2, 3->0, 4->4, 5->5, the connections become:\n\n- 1 connected to 3, 2 and 5\n- 3 connected to 1 and 0\n- 2 connected to 1, 0, 4 and 5\n- 0 connected to 3 and 2\n- 4 connected to 2 and 5\n- 5 connected to 1, 2 and 4\n\nSorting the connections alphabetically by the lowest node number, and then by the next lowest, yields:\n- 0 connected to 2 and 3 \n- 1 connected to 2, 3, and 5\n- 2 connected to 0, 1, 4, and 5\n- 3 connected to 0 and 1\n- 4 connected to 2 and 5\n- 5 connected to 1, 2, and 4\n\nFurther manipulation simplifies the list:\n-0 connected to 2 and 3 is captured by 2 connected to 0 and 3\n-Similarly for the rest, such that:\n\n- 1 connected to 2, 3 and 5\n- 2 connected to 0, 4 and 5 (since it already connected to 1)\n- 3 connected to 0 is included above as part of connection to 0\n- 4 connected to 2 and 5\n- 5 connected to 4 is included above\n\nWhich means the original post relabeled graph is:\n- 1 connected to 3, 2 and 5\n- 2 connected to 0, 4 and 5\n- 3 connected to 0\n- 4 connected to 2 and 5\n- 5 connected to 1\nAnd the first graphs connections are reflected after this.  Therefore, they do match."
