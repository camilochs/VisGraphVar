    "analysis": "The graphs have different structures. While both graphs contain nodes labeled 0-5, their connections differ significantly. Graph 1 shows a connected structure where node 3 acts as a central hub connected to nodes 1, 0, 5, and 4. Graph 2 shows a different arrangement where node 4 is central, connected to nodes 2, 5, 0, and 1, with no direct connection between nodes 3 and 1. Additionally, node 3 appears isolated in Graph 2. The overall topology and edge connections are distinctly different between the two graphs."
