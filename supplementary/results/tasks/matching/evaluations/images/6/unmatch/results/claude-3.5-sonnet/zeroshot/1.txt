    "analysis": "While both graphs contain the same number of nodes (0-5), their structures are significantly different. Graph 1 has a more linear arrangement with node 2 as a central hub connecting to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4, and node 3 connecting to node 5. Graph 2 has a different topology with node 3 serving as a hub, connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5, while node 0 is connected only to node 4. The edge connections and overall layout pattern are distinct between the two graphs."
