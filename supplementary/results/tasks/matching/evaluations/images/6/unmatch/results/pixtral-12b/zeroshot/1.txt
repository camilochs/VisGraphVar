   "analysis": "The first graph (Graph 1) has five nodes connected in a structure where node 2 is central, branching out to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5. The second graph (Graph 2) features five nodes connected to form a triangle with an additional node (node 5) connected to two nodes of the triangle, creating an extra linkage. This difference in structure indicates that the two graphs are not identical."
