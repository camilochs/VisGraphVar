    "analysis": "The graphs are different in both structure and node connections. Graph 1 shows a tree-like structure with a central node (0) connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3, plus isolated nodes 4 and 5. Graph 2 has a different arrangement with a chain of connected nodes (4-1-2-3) plus two isolated nodes (0 and 5). The number of nodes is the same (6 nodes each) but their connectivity patterns and overall topology are distinct."
