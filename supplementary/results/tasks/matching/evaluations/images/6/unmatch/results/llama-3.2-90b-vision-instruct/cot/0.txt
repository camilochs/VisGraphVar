**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Node Count and Labels:** 
   - Graph 1 has 5 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - Graph 2 also has 5 nodes, but they are labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
   - **Observation:** Both graphs have the same number of nodes, but the labels differ slightly.

2. **Connections/Edges:**
   - Graph 1 connections: (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (2,5), (3,5), (4,0).
   - Graph 2 connections: (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,0), (4,3), (2,5), (0,4).
   - **Observation:** The connections differ; Graph 1 has connections not present in Graph 2 and vice versa.

Given the differences in node labels and connections, despite having the same number of nodes, the two graphs do not match.

**Final Answer:** 

```json
{
  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "Graphs differ in node labels and connections despite having the same number of nodes."
}
