    "analysis": "Both graphs are isomorphic, containing 6 nodes (labeled 0-5) with identical connection patterns. While the layouts and colors differ (blue nodes in Graph 1, green nodes in Graph 2), the underlying structure is the same. The connectivity of each corresponding node matches perfectly, including the triangular formations and edge connections between nodes. Though visually arranged differently, they represent the same graph structure."
