Edges: Upon comparing each graph:\n   - Graph 1 edges: (0-2), (0-4), (0-5), (1-3), (1-4), (1-5), (2-5)\n   - Graph 2 edges: (0-2), (0-4), (0-5), (1-3), (1-4), (1-5), (2-5)\n4. Edge weights: No weights are visible, so they are assumed to be the same or irrelevant in both graphs.\nFinal Decision: All nodes and edges, including labels and connections, align perfectly, thus the graphs match."
