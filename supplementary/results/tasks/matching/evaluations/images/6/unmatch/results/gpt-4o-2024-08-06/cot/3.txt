There are 6 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nStep 3: Compare node labels: Both graphs have the same node labels.\nStep 4: Evaluate edges in Graph 1: (1-2), (3-0), (5-3), and (4-5).\nStep 5: Evaluate edges in Graph 2: (1-4), (4-0), (0-5), and (2-3).\nStep 6: Compare edges: The edges differ between the two graphs.\nStep 7: Compare edge weights (if any): Graph 1 edges have no weights, while Graph 2 edges are colored differently, indicating possible weights or types.\nConclusion: Although the node counts and labels are identical, the edges and edge weights/types are different, thus the graphs do not match."
