Edge Comparison:\n   - Graph 1:\n     - 0 -- 3\n     - 0 -- 5\n     - 1 -- 3\n     - 3 -- 4\n     - 3 -- 5\n     - 4 -- 5\n   - Graph 2:\n     - 0 -- 1\n     - 0 -- 4\n     - 0 -- 5\n     - 1 -- 4\n     - 2 -- 4\n     - 4 -- 5\n     - Node 3 is isolated.\n\n   As seen in the edge comparison, connections between labeled nodes differ significantly between the two graphs.  The presence of the isolated node 3 in the second graph, absent from the interconnected structure of the first graph, also demonstrates their non-matching structure."
