   "analysis": "Comparing the two graphs component by component:\n\n1. Node Count and Labels:\n- Both graphs have 6 nodes labeled 0-5\n- Node labels match exactly\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n- Graph 1 connections:\n  * 0-1\n  * 0-2\n  * 1-2\n  * 2-3\n  * 2-4\n  * 3-5\n\n- Graph 2 connections:\n  * 0-4\n  * 4-3\n  * 3-1\n  * 3-2\n  * 3-5\n  * 1-2\n\n3. Key Differences:\n- Graph 1 has node 2 as a central hub with 4 connections\n- Graph 2 has node 3 as a central hub with 4 connections\n- The overall connection patterns are different\n- Graph 1 forms a more linear structure\n- Graph 2 has a more star-like topology\n\nWhile both graphs contain the same nodes, their connection patterns are significantly different, therefore they do not match."
