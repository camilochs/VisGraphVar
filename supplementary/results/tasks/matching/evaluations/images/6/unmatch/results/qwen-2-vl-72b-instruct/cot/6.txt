   "analysis": "Upon comparing the two graphs, it is clear that while they both have the same number of nodes (6) and the same node labels, the connections (edges) between the nodes are different. In Graph 1, the connections are as follows: 0-1, 0-3, 0-4, 1-2, 1-5, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5. In Graph 2, the connections are as follows: 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 3-4, 3-5, 4-5. These differences in the connections between the nodes indicate that the two graphs do not match."
