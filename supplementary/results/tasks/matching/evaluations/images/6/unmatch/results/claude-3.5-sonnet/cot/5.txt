   "analysis": "1. Node Count Check:\n   - Both graphs have 7 nodes labeled 0-5\n   - Node count matches\n\n2. Node Connectivity Analysis:\n   - Graph 1:\n     * Node 0 connects to nodes 3, 4, and 5\n     * Node 5 connects to node 1\n     * Node 2 is isolated\n   - Graph 2:\n     * Node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 2\n     * Node 1 connects to nodes 4 and 5\n     * Node 3 is isolated\n\n3. Edge Count and Pattern:\n   - Graph 1 has 4 edges\n   - Graph 2 has 4 edges\n   - Despite same edge count, connection patterns differ significantly\n\n4. Overall Structure:\n   - Graph 1 forms a tree-like structure with an isolated node\n   - Graph 2 forms a different tree-like structure with a different isolated node\n\nConclusion: While the graphs contain the same number of nodes and edges, their connection patterns and overall structures are different, therefore they do not match."
