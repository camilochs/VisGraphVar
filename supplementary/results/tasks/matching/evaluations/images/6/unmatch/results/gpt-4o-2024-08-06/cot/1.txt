   "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Node Count: Both graphs have 6 nodes, so node count matches.\n\n2. Node Labels: Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Node labels match.\n\n3. Edges:\n   - Graph 1 has edges: (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5).\n   - Graph 2 has edges: (0,4), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), (3,5), (1,2).\n   - The edges differ as Graph 1 does not have (0,4), (1,3), or (1,2), which are present in Graph 2.\n\n4. Edge Weights: Not applicable as there are no weights shown in either graph.\n\nConclusion: The graphs have different edge connections, hence they do not match."
