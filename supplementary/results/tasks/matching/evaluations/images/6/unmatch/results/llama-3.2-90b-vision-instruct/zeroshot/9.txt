To determine if the two graph images match, we need to compare their structures, node connections, and any weights if present.

**Step 1: Compare the number of nodes**

Graph 1 has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Graph 2 also has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Step 2: Compare the connections between nodes**

In Graph 1, the connections are:
* 0 is connected to 4
* 1 is connected to 2 and 5
* 2 is connected to 1 and 3
* 3 is connected to 2
* 4 is connected to 0

In Graph 2, the connections are:
* 0 is connected to 3
* 1 is connected to 5
* 2 is connected to 0 and 3
* 3 is connected to 0 and 2
* 4 is connected to none

**Step 3: Compare any weights if present**

Both graphs do not have any weights on their edges.

**Conclusion**

Based on the comparison, we can see that Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match. The connections between nodes are different in both graphs.

Therefore, the final answer is:

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The connections between nodes in Graph 1 and Graph 2 are different."
}
```
