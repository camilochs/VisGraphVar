Node Labels Comparison:\n- Graph 1 contains nodes: 0,1,2,3,4,5\n- Graph 2 contains nodes: 0,1,2,3,4,5\n\n3. Edge Comparison:\n- Graph 1 has edges: (1-2), (1-4), (1-5), (2-5), (3-5)\n- Graph 2 has edges: (0-2), (0-3), (0-4), (2-3), (2-5)\n\n4. Structure Comparison:\n- Graph 1 forms a connected component with node 0 isolated\n- Graph 2 has a connected component and node 1 isolated\n\nConclusion: The graphs do not match because:\n- Different edge connections between nodes\n- Different overall structure\n- Different isolated nodes (0 in Graph 1, 1 in Graph 2)"
