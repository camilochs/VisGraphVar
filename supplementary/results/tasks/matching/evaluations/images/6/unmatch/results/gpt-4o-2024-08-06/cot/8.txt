   "analysis": "Step 1: Node count comparison - Both Graph 1 and Graph 2 have 6 nodes.\n\nStep 2: Node label comparison - Graph 1 has nodes labeled [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], while Graph 2 has nodes labeled [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Labels match.\n\nStep 3: Edge comparison - Graph 1 has edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), and (2, 3). Graph 2 has edges: (1, 3), (3, 4). The edges do not match as Graph 2 is missing (0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 3), and has additional edges (1, 3), (3, 4).\n\nStep 4: Edge weight comparison - Both graphs do not have any weights indicated, assuming weights do not affect comparison.\n\nConclusion: Despite having same node labels, the edges between nodes in Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match, resulting in the graphs being different. Therefore, they do not match."
