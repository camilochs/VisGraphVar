**Analysis of Graph Images**

To determine if the two given graph images match, we need to examine their structures, node connections, and weights (if present). 

Since the actual graph images are not provided in the text, we will describe a general approach for comparing graph images.

**General Approach**

1. **Visual Inspection**: Compare the overall layout and structure of the two graphs.
2. **Node Comparison**: Check if the number of nodes and their labels are identical in both graphs.
3. **Edge Comparison**: Verify that the number of edges and their connections between nodes are the same in both graphs.
4. **Weight Comparison**: If weights are present, ensure that they are identical for corresponding edges in both graphs.
5. **Directionality**: If the graphs are directed, check that the direction of edges is consistent across both graphs.

**Conclusion**

Without the actual graph images, we cannot provide a definitive answer. However, by following the above steps, you can compare the given graphs and determine if they match.

**Sample Output**

```json
{
   "match": "yes" or "no",
   "analysis": "Explanation of key similarities or differences observed between the graphs."
}
```

If the graphs match, the output would be:

```json
{
   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "The graphs have identical structures, node connections, and weights."
}
```

If the graphs do not match, the output would be:

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The graphs differ in their structures, node connections, or weights."
}
```
