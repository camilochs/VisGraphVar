Comparing Node Counts and Labels:\n   - Graph 1 has 6 nodes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n   - Graph 2 has 5 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n   Difference found: Graph 1 has an additional node.\n\n2. Comparing Connections (Edges) in Graph 1:\n   - Node 1 connects to Node 3.\n   - Node 3 connects to Node 5.\n   - Node 2 connects to Node 5.\n   - Node 5 connects to Node 4.\n   - Node 5 connects to Node 6.\n\n3. Comparing Connections (Edges) in Graph 2:\n   - Node 0 connects to Node 4.\n   - Node 0 connects to Node 2.\n   - Node 0 connects to Node 3.\n   - Node 4 connects to Node 2.\n   - Node 4 connects to Node 1.\n\n4. Evaluating Edges and Weights:\n   - Edges in Graph 1 are represented by pairs of nodes.\n   - Edges in Graph 2 are also pairs of nodes without weights.\n   Difference not found in edge count but difference due to node labels.\n\nConclusion:\n   - The node count difference and the additional nodes with labels in Graph 1 indicate the graphs do not match."
