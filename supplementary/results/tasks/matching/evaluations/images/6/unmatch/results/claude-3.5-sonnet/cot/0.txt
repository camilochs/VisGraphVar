Edge Analysis:\n- Node 0 connects to nodes 2, 4, and 5 in both graphs\n- Node 1 connects to nodes 3, 4, and 5 in both graphs\n- Node 2 connects to nodes 0, 1, and 4 in both graphs\n- Node 3 connects to nodes 1 and 2 in both graphs\n- Node 4 connects to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5 in both graphs\n- Node 5 connects to nodes 0, 1, and 4 in both graphs\n\n3. Overall Structure:\n- Despite different visual layouts (Graph 1 uses gray edges, Graph 2 uses orange edges)\n- The connectivity pattern is identical\n- No weights are shown in either graph, so only topology matters\n\nConclusion: The graphs are isomorphic - they have identical structure and connectivity patterns, just arranged differently visually."
