    "analysis": "The graphs are not identical. While both graphs contain nodes labeled 0-5, they have different structures. Graph 1 has a triangular component connecting nodes 0, 2, and 3, with nodes 1, 4, and 5 isolated. Graph 2 has a connected component of nodes 3, 4, and 1, with nodes 0, 2, and 5 being isolated. The connection patterns and overall topology are different between the two graphs."
