Node counts and labels do not align because Graph 1â€™s node 0 is isolated, while in Graph 2, node 1 is isolated.\nStep 2: Evaluate edges and weights: \n- Graph 1: Edges (0, none), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n- Graph 2: Edges (1, none), (0,2), (0,4), (2,3), (2,5)\nEdges and connections differ between the graphs.\nConclusion: The graphs do not match as they have different edge configurations and isolated nodes."
