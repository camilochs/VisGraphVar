**Step 1: Count Number of Nodes in Graphs**

The first step is to count the number of nodes in each graph.  Based on the figure, both of the graphs have 5 nodes. Therefore, they have the same number of nodes.

**Analysis:**

The first step is to count the number of nodes in each graph. 

*   Number of nodes in Graph 1: 5
*   Number of nodes in Graph 2: 5

Both are the same.

**Step 2: Label and Connect Edges**

Once the number of nodes is the same, the labels on the nodes should be evaluated. Then, the edges connected between the graph elements should be evaluated. Each of these is crucial in evaluating if the two graphs are the same.

*   Number of nodes in Graph 1: 5
*   Number of nodes in Graph 2: 5

    *   Number of edges (or lines between the elements to connect) Graph 1: 6
    *   Number of edges in Graph 2: 4 (or) since the example does not show the orange lines between 1,3,4, an unknown number but different than graph 1

**Analysis:**

**Number of elements between each of the nodes when comparing each of the elements:** 

As illustrated in the example above, analyzing each of the elements reveals that Graph 1 and Graph 2 are different because one has six edges, while the other has four.
