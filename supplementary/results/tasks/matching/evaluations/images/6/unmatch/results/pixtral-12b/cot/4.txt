Count of Nodes:\n   - Graph 1 has 5 nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.\n   - Graph 2 has 5 nodes labeled 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\n2. Node Labels:\n   - Graph 1 labels are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.\n   - Graph 2 labels are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n   - The node labels do not match.\n\n3. Connection Pattern:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes connected in a somewhat irregular pattern with some edges present.\n   - Graph 2 has connections forming a roughly triangular configuration, with specific orange edges.\n\n4. Evaluation of Unique Node Pairs:\n   - Graph 1 has a node labeled '9' that does not appear in Graph 2.\n   - Similarly, Graph 2 has nodes labeled '5', '6', and '7', which do not appear in Graph 1.\n\nGiven these discrepancies innode labels and the unique presence of certain node pairs, the graphs do not match.\n"
