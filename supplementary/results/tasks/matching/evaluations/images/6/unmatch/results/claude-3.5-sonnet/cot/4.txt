    "match": "no",
    "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels:\n- Both graphs have 6 nodes each\n- Both graphs use numeric labels from 0-5\n- However, Graph 1 additionally has nodes labeled 1,3,4 connected, while Graph 2 has nodes labeled 2,3 isolated\n\n2. Edge Comparison:\n- Graph 1 has 6 edges forming a connected component\n- Graph 2 has 5 edges and has disconnected nodes\n- Graph 1's edges form a more dense connection between nodes 0,3,4,5\n- Graph 2's edges form a different pattern centered around node 4\n\n3. Structure:\n- Graph 1 is a single connected component\n- Graph 2 has disconnected nodes (2 and 3 are isolated)\n- The overall topology is different between the graphs\n\n4. Final Decision:\nThe graphs do not match because they have different edge connections, different connectivity patterns, and different overall structures despite having the same number of nodes."
