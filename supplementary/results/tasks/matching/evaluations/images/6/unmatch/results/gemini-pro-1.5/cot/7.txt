Let's analyze the edges:\n\nGraph 1:\n- 0 connected to 1\n- 0 connected to 3\n- 1 connected to 3\n- 0 connected to 5\n- 5 connected to 2\n- 5 connected to 4\n\nGraph 2:\n- 0 connected to 1\n- 0 connected to 3\n- 1 connected to 2 \n- 1 connected to 4\n- 2 connected to 4\n- 0 connected to 5\n\nBy comparing the connections, we observe the following mapping between the nodes of the two graphs:\n\nGraph 1 | Graph 2\n------- | --------\n0 | 0\n1 | 3\n3 | 5\n5 | 1\n2 | 4\n4 | 2\n\nWith this mapping, we can see that all edges correspond. For example, the edge 0-1 in Graph 1 corresponds to edge 0-3 in Graph 2. Edge 0-3 in Graph 1 corresponds to 0-5 in Graph 2. The edge 1-3 in Graph 1 corresponds to the edge 3-5 in Graph 2. Following this pattern confirms all the edges match. Therefore, the graphs are isomorphic."
