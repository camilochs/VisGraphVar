{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Graph 1 and Graph 2 have the same number of nodes and the same node labels, but the connections or edges between the nodes differ. For example, in Graph 1, there is a connection between nodes 0 and 2, whereas in Graph 2, nodes 0 and 2 are not connected. Therefore, the two graphs do not match."
