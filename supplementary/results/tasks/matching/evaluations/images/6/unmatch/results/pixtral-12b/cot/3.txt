Analysis:

1. **Node Counts and Labels:**
   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 4, 5, 3, 2.
   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 4, 0, 2, 1.

   Both graphs have differently labeled nodes.

2. **Node Comparisons:**
   - Nodes in Graph 1: 
     - 4, 5, 3, and 2
   - Nodes in Graph 2 
     - 4, 0, 2, and 1

   Direct one-to-one comparison shows different order and distinct node labels (e.g., Graph 1 uses 5 which does not exist in Graph 2 and Graph 2 uses 0 which does not exist in Graph 1).

3. **Edges and Connections:**
   - In Graph 1:
     - An edge connects nodes 4 to 5
     - An edge connects nodes 5 to 3
     - An edge connects nodes 3 to 2
   - In Graph 2:
     - An edge connects nodes 4 to 0
     - An edge connects nodes 0 to 1
     - An edge connects nodes 2 to 1

   Not only are the node labels different, but the connections and sequence of connections are also not identical.

Given these differences in node labels, connections, and adjacency structure, I can conclude the graphs do not match.
