      "Step 1 Result: Both Graph 1 and Graph 2 have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, totaling 6 nodes each.",
      "Step 2: Compare the structure and connections of the nodes in Graph 1 versus Graph 2.",
      "Step 2 Result: In Graph 1, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected with node 0 serving as a central node. Nodes 3 and 5 are not connected to any other nodes in the graph.",
      "Step 2 Result: In Graph 2, node 0 serves as the central node connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Additionally, nodes 1 and 3 form an edge, while nodes 4 and 1 form another edge independently.",
      "Step 3: Compare edge weights if applicable. If there are no weights shown, assume unweighted edges.",
      "Step 3 Result: There are no indicated edge weights in either graph.",
      "Step 4: Determine any missing or extra elements in either graph.",
      "Step 4 Result: Node 2 in Graph 1 has no connection to any other node, whereas in Graph 2, node 2 is connected to node 0.",
      "Conclusion: Despite having the same nodes with matching labels, the connections and specific structures differ. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
