  "analysis": "The graphs do not match. Though they have the same number of nodes, the connections between the nodes are different. For example, in Graph 1, node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5. In Graph 2, node 1 is isolated. Several other connections are also different: Graph 1 has edges (1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 1), (5, 3) while Graph 2 has edges (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5). Additionally, the edges in Graph 2 are colored orange while graph 1's edges are grey."
