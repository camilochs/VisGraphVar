   "analysis": "Step 1: Node Count - Both graphs have 6 nodes, labeled 0 to 5. Step 2: Edge and Connection Check - Graph 1 has edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 5). Graph 2 has edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4). The edges are the same except for labeling and positioning differences within the drawings. Step 3: Edge Weight - Both graphs have unweighted edges. Step 4: Conclusion - Nodes and connections match upon re-mapping node labels between graphs, despite differences in visual layout. Therefore, the graphs match."
