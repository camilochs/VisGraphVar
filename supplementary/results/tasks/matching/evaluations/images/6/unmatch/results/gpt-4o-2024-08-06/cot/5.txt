   "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 6 nodes each, which initially suggests a possible match.\n\n2. Node Labels: \n   - Graph 1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Graph 2: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Node labels are identical.\n\n3. Edges: \n   - Graph 1 Edges: (1-5), (5-0), (0-4), (0-3)\n   - Graph 2 Edges: (2-0), (0-1), (1-5), (1-4)\n   - The connections in both graphs are different.\n\n4. Edge Weights: Not explicitly shown in either graph, but the presence of different colors in the edges of Graph 2 may indicate weighting which is not in Graph 1.\n\nConclusion: While the node labels and counts match, the edges and their connections do not align between the graphs, leading to the conclusion that they do not match."
