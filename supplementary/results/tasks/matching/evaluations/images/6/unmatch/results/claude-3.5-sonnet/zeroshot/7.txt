    "analysis": "The graphs have different structures and connections. Graph 1 shows a structure with 6 nodes (0-5) where node 5 is central and connects to nodes 2 and 4, while node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 3. Graph 2 also has 6 nodes (0-5) but has a different arrangement where node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5, and node 1 connects to nodes 2 and 4. The overall topology, number of edges, and connection patterns are distinct between the two graphs."
