{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs have different structures. Graph 1 has a node with three edges (node 5), while Graph 2 does not. Additionally, the node labels are not matched correctly between the two graphs (e.g., node 0 in Graph 1 is not connected to the same nodes as node 0 in Graph 2). Therefore, the graphs do not match."
