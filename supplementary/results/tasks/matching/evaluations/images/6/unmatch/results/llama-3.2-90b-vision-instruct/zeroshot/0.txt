Given two graph images are not provided, this response cannot conclusively determine whether the graphs match or not. To provide an accurate assessment, please share the graph images.

**Assuming hypothetical graphs:**
Suppose we have two hypothetical graphs, Graph 1 and Graph 2, with the following structures:

**Graph 1:**
- Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Edges:
  + 1 -> 2 (weight: 3)
  + 2 -> 3 (weight: 2)
  + 3 -> 4 (weight: 1)
  + 4 -> 5 (weight: 4)
  + 5 -> 1 (weight: 5)

**Graph 2:**
- Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Edges:
  + 1 -> 2 (weight: 3)
  + 2 -> 3 (weight: 2)
  + 3 -> 4 (weight: 1)
  + 4 -> 5 (weight: 4)
  + 5 -> 1 (weight: 5)

**Response in JSON format:**
```json
{
   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "Both graphs have identical structures, node connections, and weights, indicating a perfect match."
}
```

Please note that this response is hypothetical and would change based on the actual graph images provided.
