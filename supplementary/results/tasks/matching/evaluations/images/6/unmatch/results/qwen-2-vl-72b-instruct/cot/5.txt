   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match. Here is a step-by-step explanation of each element compared:\n\n1. Node Counts and Labels:\n   - Graph 1 has 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n   - Graph 2 has 7 nodes labeled from 0 to 6 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n   These node counts and labels do not match, indicating a difference in the structure of the graphs.\n\n2. Connections or Edges:\n   - Graph 1 has connections between nodes such as 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 1-4, 2-5, 3-6, 4-7, 5-8, 6-9.\n   - Graph 2 has connections between nodes such as 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6.\n   The connections or edges in the two graphs are not the same, further indicating a difference in the structure of the graphs.\n\nBased on these differences in node counts, labels, and connections, the two graphs do not match."
