**Analysis of Graph Similarity**

Upon examining the two graph images, it is evident that they exhibit distinct structural differences.

*   **Graph 1:**
    *   Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
    *   Node 1 is isolated (disconnected).
    *   Nodes 4 and 5 are also isolated and not connected to any other nodes or edges.
    *   No weights are present in the graph.
*   **Graph 2:**
    *   Node 0 is isolated (disconnected).
    *   Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
    *   Node 2 is isolated (disconnected).
    *   Node 5 is isolated (disconnected).
    *   No weights are present in the graph.

**Conclusion**

The graphs do not match as they have different node connections and no weights are present in either graph.
