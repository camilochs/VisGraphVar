   "analysis": "The graphs have different structures. Graph 1 has a connected chain with nodes labeled from 1 to 6 in sequence, while Graph 2 is more complex with nodes labeled from 1 to 6 but with multiple branching paths. Additionally, nodes 1, 2, and 3 in Graph 1 are connected linearly, but Graph 2 seems to branch out from node 2 and partly elsewhere. These differences suggest that the graphs are not the same."
