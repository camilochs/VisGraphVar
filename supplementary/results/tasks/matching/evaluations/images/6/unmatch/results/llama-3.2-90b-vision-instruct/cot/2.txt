**Step-by-Step Graph Comparison Analysis**

### Step 1: Node Count and Label Comparison
•  Graph 1 has 5 labeled nodes (0-4).
•  Graph 2 has 5 labeled nodes (0-4).

**Comparison Result**: Both graphs have the same node count and labels.

### Step 2: Edge Connection Comparison

**Graph 1**:

•  Node 0 is connected to node 2 with a weight of 1.
•  Node 1 is connected to node 3 with a weight of 0.
•  Node 3 is connected to node 4 with a weight of 5.
•  Node 5 is an isolated node.

**Graph 2**:

•  Nodes 0 and 4 are connected with an unknown weight.
•  Nodes 1 and 3 are connected with unknown weights.
•  Node 2 is an isolated node.
•  Node 5 is an isolated node.

**Comparison Result**:

•  Graph 1 has specificweights for each connection:
- Node 0 to Node 2 with a weight of 1
- Node 1 to Node 3 with a weight of 0
- Node 3 to Node 4 with a weight of 5
•  Graph 2 has unknown weights for connections.

**Conclusion**:

•  Both graphs match in terms of node count and labels.
•  However, they do not match in terms of edge connections and weights:
- Different weights for connections
- Graph 2 has unknown weights
- Nodes 0 to 4 have different connections in both graphs.

**Final Conclusion**: The graphs do not match.

**JSON Output**:

{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Node count and labels match, but edge connections and weights differ. Graphs do not match."
