**Graph Comparison Analysis**

To determine if the two given graphs match, a comprehensive component-by-component analysis is conducted. This involves comparing the node counts and labels, as well as evaluating each connection or edge, including any assigned weights.

**Node Count and Label Comparison**

*   **Node Count:** Both graphs have a total of 5 nodes.
*   **Node Labels:** The nodes in both graphs are labeled 0 through 4, indicating identical node naming conventions.

**Connection (Edge) Comparison**

*   **Edge 1 (0-3):** Both graphs have a direct connection between node 3 and node 0.
*   **Edge 2 (0-1):** A connection exists between node 1 and node 0 in both graphs.
*   **Edge 3 (1-2):** Both graphs contain a connection between node 2 and node 1.
*   **Edge 4 (4-5):** There is a connection between node 4 and node 5 in both graphs.
*   **Edge 5 (2-5) and Edge 6 (0-2):** Graph 2 has additional connections; Edge 5 connects node 5 directly to node 2, and while not shown in Graph 1, node 0 connects to node 2 through an additional unlabeled weight.

**Conclusion**

Based on the step-by-step analysis, Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match due to the differences in their connections as described in the conclusion.
