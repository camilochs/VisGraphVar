Node Labels:\n   - Graph 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Graph 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   The labels of the nodes also match.\n3. Edges:\n   - Graph 1: 1 connects to 2, 2 connects to 1 and 3, 3 connects to 2 and 5, 4 connects to 1 and 2, 5 connects to 3.\n   - Graph 2: 1 connects to 2 and 3, 2 connects to 3, 3 connects to 1 and 4, 4 connects to 3, 5 connects to 1 and 2.\n   The edge connections are different between the two graphs.\nGiven these matches and differences, especially in the edges, it can be concluded that the two graphs do not match."
