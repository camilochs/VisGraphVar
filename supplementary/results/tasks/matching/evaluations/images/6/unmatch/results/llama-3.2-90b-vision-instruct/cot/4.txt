**Graph Comparison Analysis**

To determine if two graphs are identical, we must compare their structures. Node similarity is determined by node count and matching labels. Edge similarity is determined by matching source and target nodes and possibly matching weights.



**Step 1: Node Comparison**

*   Graph 1 and Graph 2 have the same number of nodes (5).
*   Node labels are identical in both graphs: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].



**Step 2: Edge Comparison**

*   Graph 1 and Graph 2 have the same edges:
    *   0-1
    *   1-3
    *   3-0
    *   4-5
    *   2-4
    *   *   Additional 4-2 edge in Graph 2 is missing in Graph 1.



The graphs in the prompt do not match. It is possible the extra edge (4,2) with weight 0 was a mistake when copying, but without further details it shall be assumed to be a part of the new graph. The analysis below demonstrates the step-by-step approach for how the graphs were determined non-matching.



*   Graph 1 and Graph 2 have 5 nodes. These nodes are referred to by identical labels: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
*   Graph 1 has only 4 edges described, to compare against the graph with 6 edges it is important to also analyze the extra two edges provided.
*   In the prompt Graph 1 has the edges (0,1), (3,0), (4,5), and (2,4).
*   Graph 2 contains all four of Graph 1's edges and adds (0,3) and (4,2) edges.
*   Looking at edge (0,1), Graph 2 and Graph 1 have matching source nodes (0) and matching target nodes (1) without weights or differing degrees.
