   "analysis": "Comparing the nodes, we see that both graphs have the same number of nodes (6 each) and the same labels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). However, the connections (edges) between the nodes are different. In Graph 1, the connections are as follows: 0->1, 0->2, 1->2, 2->3, 2->4, 3->5. In Graph 2, the connections are different: 0->1, 0->3, 1->3, 1->2, 2->3, 3->5. Since the connections do not match, the two graphs do not match."
