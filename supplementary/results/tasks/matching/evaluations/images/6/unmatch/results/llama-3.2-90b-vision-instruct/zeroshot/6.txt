Let's analyze the two graph images to determine if they match.

**Graph 1:**

* Nodes: 5 (labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)
* Edges:
	+ 0-1
	+ 0-2
	+ 0-4
	+ 1-2
	+ 1-5
	+ 2-3
	+ 3-4
	+ 4-5

**Graph 2:**

* Nodes: 5 (labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5)
* Edges:
	+ 0-2
	+ 0-3
	+ 1-2
	+ 2-3
	+ 3-4
	+ 1-4
	+ 4-5

After comparing the two graphs, it is evident that they do not have the same structure or node connections.

**Answer:**

```json
{
  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "The graphs have different edge connections. For example, Graph 1 has an edge between nodes 0 and 1, while Graph 2 does not. Similarly, Graph 2 has an edge between nodes 1 and 4, which is not present in Graph 1."
}
```

In conclusion, the two graphs do not match due to differences in their edge connections.
