   "analysis": "Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match. Here is the step-by-step explanation of each element compared and why the final decision was reached:\n\n1. Node Counts: Both graphs have the same number of nodes (6).\n2. Node Labels: The node labels for Graph 1 are [0, 1, 3, 4, 5] and for Graph 2 are [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]. The labels do not match.\n3. Connections or Edges: The edges in Graph 1 are different from those in Graph 2. For example, in Graph 1, node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5, while in Graph 2, node 2 is connected to node 4 only.\n4. Weights: There are no weights provided in the graphs, so this is not a factor in determining a match.\n\nConclusion: Due to the differences in node labels and connections, Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match."
