   "analysis": "The graphs have significant structural differences. Graph 1 shows a tree-like structure with node 0 as a central hub connecting to nodes 4, 3, and through node 5 to node 1. Graph 2 has a different linear arrangement with nodes connected in sequence (2-0-1-4) plus nodes 5 and 3 as branches. While both graphs contain the same number of nodes (6) with labels 0-5, their connection patterns and overall topology are distinct."
