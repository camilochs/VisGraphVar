    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels Check:\n- Both graphs have 6 nodes labeled 0-5\n- Node positions are different but labels match\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n- Node 0 connections: Both graphs show connections to nodes 1, 2, and 4\n- Node 1 connections: Both graphs show connections to nodes 0, 2, and 5\n- Node 2 connections: Both graphs show connections to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5\n- Node 3 connections: Both graphs show connections to nodes 2 and 4\n- Node 4 connections: Both graphs show connections to nodes 0, 3, and 5\n- Node 5 connections: Both graphs show connections to nodes 1, 2, and 4\n\n3. Edge Weight Analysis:\n- All edges appear to have the same weight (uniform lines)\n\n4. Overall Structure:\n- While the layout and colors differ (blue vs green nodes, gray vs orange edges), the underlying graph structure is identical\n- Both graphs represent the same connections between nodes\n\nConclusion: The graphs are isomorphic - they have the same structure and connectivity pattern, just displayed with different layouts and visual styles."
