    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "Both graphs have identical structure despite different layouts and colors. Each graph contains 5 nodes (labeled 0-4) with the same connection pattern. In both graphs, node 0 connects to nodes 2 and 4, node 1 connects to nodes 2 and 3, node 2 connects to nodes 0 and 1, node 3 connects to node 1, and node 4 connects to node 0. The only difference is the visual presentation (blue vs green nodes and different spatial arrangements), but the underlying graph structure is the same."
