Node Labels: Both graphs have identical node labels from 0 to 4. \n\n3. Edges: \n   - Graph 1 edges: (0-1), (0-2), (0-3), (0-4), (3-4)\n   - Graph 2 edges: (0-1), (0-2), (0-3), (0-4), (3-4)\n   The edges in both graphs are identical.\n\n4. Weights: No weights are present in either graph.\n\nConclusion: Both graphs have the same nodes and connections. The final decision is that the graphs match."
