   "analysis": "Step 1: Compare node counts - Graph 1 has 4 nodes (0, 1, 2, 4); Graph 2 has 4 nodes as well (0, 1, 2, 3). The node labels do not match because Graph 1 includes node 4 while Graph 2 includes node 3. Step 2: Compare connections - Graph 1 has edges (0-1, 0-2, 1-2); Graph 2 has edges (0-1, 0-2, 1-2). The edges themselves are the same, but Graph 2's edges appear to be weighted differently (appears in a different color), which suggests additional differences. Step 3: Conclusion - While the connectivity pattern within the core triangle is the same, the different node labels and potential edge weights indicate the graphs do not match."
