   "analysis": "The two graphs have different structures and node connections. In Graph 1, there is a triangular structure with nodes 0, 1, and 2, while in Graph 2, there is also a triangular structure but with nodes labeled differently (0, 1, 2) and potentially different connections or weights. Additionally, the isolated nodes in each graph do not match in their positioning or connections."
