The first graph has four nodes labeled 0-4. It also has four edges:

*   The edge connected to node (0) has two connects: nodes (1) and (2).
*   The edge connected to node (3) maintains a connection to node (1).
*   The last edge, connected to node (4), connects directly to node (0).
    *   **Conclusion** - The second graph is missing the last edge connecting node 4 and node 0, so it does not match with Graph 1.

Conclusion: 
The two graphs do not have the same layout or layout count, since the second graph has two edges and fewer node labels in screenshots. قدم'^' 4

 

Answer: 

{"match": "no", "analysis": "Graph 2 lacks node 4 and direct adjacency with node 0, indicating a deviation that cannot be reconciled with the requirements of graph 1."}.
