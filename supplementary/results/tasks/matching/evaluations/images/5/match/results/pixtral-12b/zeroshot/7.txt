   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The graphs shown do not match. While both graphs have the same set of nodes and nodes labeled with the same numbers, the connections (edges) are different. For instance, in Graph 1, the node 1 has a direct connection to the node labeled 5. In Graph 2, there is no such direct connection between node 1 and node 5. Additionally, the colors and potential weight differences in the edges are also not aligned between the two graphs."
