   "analysis": "The graphs are clearly different. Graph 1 contains two separate components: one with three nodes (2-4-0) in a linear arrangement and another with two nodes (1-3) connected by a single edge. Graph 2 also has two separate components but with different structures: one component has three nodes (0-4-2) in a linear arrangement and another component has two nodes (1-3) connected by a single edge. While both graphs have similar numbers of nodes and edges, their connectivity patterns and node labels are different, making them non-matching graphs."
