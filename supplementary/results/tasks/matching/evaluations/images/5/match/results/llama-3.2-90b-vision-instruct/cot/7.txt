**Step-by-Step Analysis**

### Step 1: Node Count Comparison

* Graph 1 has 4 nodes.
* Graph 2 has 4 nodes.
* The node counts in both graphs are equal.

### Step 2: Node Labeling Comparison

* Graph 1 has node labels: 2, 3, 4, 0.
* Graph 2 has node labels: 2, 3, 4, 0.
* The node labels in both graphs are identical.

### Step 3: Edge and Weight Comparison

* Graph 1 has edges: (2,3), (3,0), (0,1), (1,4).
	+ Weights: No explicit weights mentioned in the problem.
* Graph 2 has edges: (2,3), (3,0), (0,1), (1,4).
	+ Weights: No explicit weights mentioned in the problem.
* Both graphs have the same edges and, implicitly by not being mentioned, the same weight configuration (absence of weights).

### Conclusion

Given that the node counts, labels, edges, and weights (or lack thereof) match between the two graphs, the answer is:

```json
{
  "match": "yes",
  "analysis": "Matching nodes, labels, edges, and absence of differing weights indicate these graphs are identical."
}
