   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "The two graphs are structurally identical. Both graphs contain 5 nodes (labeled 0-4) with the same connection pattern: node 4 is central and connects to nodes 0, 1, and 3, while node 3 connects to node 2. The only difference is the visual representation - Graph 1 uses blue nodes and gray edges, while Graph 2 uses green nodes and orange edges. The underlying structure and connectivity remain the same."
