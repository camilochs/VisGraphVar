   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 5 nodes each - verified.\n2. Node Labels: Both graphs have nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4 - verified.\n3. Node Positions: The layouts are different between the graphs:\n   - Graph 1: Nodes 2 and 3 are close together at top-left, nodes 1 and 0 are separated at bottom-left, node 4 is in middle\n   - Graph 2: Nodes 2 and 3 are at bottom-right, nodes 0 and 1 are in middle-right area, node 4 is at top\n4. Edge Analysis: \n   - Graph 1 appears to have nodes 2 and 3 connected\n   - Graph 2 has no visible edges between any nodes\n5. Final Decision: The graphs do not match because Graph 1 has an edge connecting nodes 2 and 3, while Graph 2 has no edges at all."
