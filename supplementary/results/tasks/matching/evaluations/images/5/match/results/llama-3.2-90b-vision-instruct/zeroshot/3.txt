To assess if the two graphs match, it is essential to examine their structures, node connections, and weights.

**Node Connections**

The following node connections are observed:
- In Graph 1:
	+ Node 0 is connected to node 2.
	+ Node 0 is connected to node 4.
	+ Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- In Graph 2:
	+ Node 0 is connected to node 4.
	+ Node 0 is connected to node 2.
	+ Node 1 is connected to node 3.

The connection patterns in both graphs are identical.

**Weights**

The weights of the nodes are as follows:
- In Graph 1:
	+ Node 0 has a weight of 0.
	+ Node 2 has a weight of 2.
	+ Node 4 has a weight of 4.
	+ Node 1 has a weight of 1.
	+ Node 3 has a weight of 3.
- In Graph 2:
	+ Node 0 has a weight of 0.
	+ Node 4 has a weight of 4.
	+ Node 2 has a weight of 2.
	+ Node 1 has a weight of 1.
	+ Node 3 has a weight of 3.

The weights of the nodes in both graphs match exactly.

**Conclusion**

Given that both the connection patterns and weights of the nodes are identical across the two graphs, these graphs match.
