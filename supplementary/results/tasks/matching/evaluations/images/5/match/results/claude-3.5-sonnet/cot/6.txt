   "analysis": "1. Node count comparison:\n   - Both graphs have 5 nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4\n   - Node count matches\n\n2. Node positions:\n   - Graph 1 has node 3 isolated at top\n   - Graph 2 has node 3 isolated at top\n   - Other nodes have different arrangements\n\n3. Edge comparison:\n   - Graph 1 has 4 edges forming a tree-like structure connecting nodes 0,1,2,4\n   - Graph 2 has 4 edges forming a different pattern with nodes 0,1,2,4\n   - Edge patterns are different:\n     * Graph 1: Edges between (0-1), (0-2), (1-2), (2-4)\n     * Graph 2: Edges between (0-1), (0-2), (1-2), (2-4) but in a different configuration\n\n4. Visual structure:\n   - Graph 1 has a more centralized structure\n   - Graph 2 has a more linear arrangement\n\nConclusion: While the graphs have the same number of nodes and edges, their structural arrangements are different, therefore they do not match."
