Graph 2 has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\nStep 2: Comparing Node Labels - All node labels match between the graphs.\nStep 3: Evaluating Connections - Graph 1 has an edge between nodes 2 and 3. Graph 2 has an edge between nodes 2 and 3 with a visible weight. The weights differ, indicating a mismatch.\nConclusion: The graphs do not match due to differing edge weights between nodes 2 and 3."
