   "analysis": "Both graphs contain the same nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and edges between the nodes form a cycle with additional edges creating two triangles. The node connections (0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-0, and 0-2 or 2-4) are identical in structure. Though the layout and colors differ, the structural connections match."
