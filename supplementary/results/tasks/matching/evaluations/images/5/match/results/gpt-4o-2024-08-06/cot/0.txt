   "analysis": "1. Node count: Both graphs have 5 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n2. Node labels: All nodes are labeled consistently (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) in both graphs.\n3. Edges: Both graphs have the same connections:\n   - Graph 1 edges: (0,4), (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), and (3,2)\n   - Graph 2 edges: (0,4), (0,1), (0,3), (1,2), and (3,2)\n4. Edge weights: No weights are present in either graph, which is consistent.\n5. Conclusion: The graphs match in terms of nodes, edges, and lack of weights."
