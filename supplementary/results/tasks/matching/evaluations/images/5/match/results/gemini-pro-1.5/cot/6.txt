  "analysis": "Graph 1 has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Graph 2 also has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. In Graph 1, the connections are: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 4). Node 3 is disconnected. In Graph 2, the connections are: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 4). Node 3 is disconnected. While the node labels and the number of components are the same, the edges are different. In Graph 1, the edges are undirected and visually represented by grey lines, suggesting no specific properties. Graph 2 has orange-colored edges, visually indicating they are likely directed or have weights, contrasting with Graph 1. This difference in connections between corresponding nodes leads to the conclusion of non-match."
