Edge comparison:\n   - Graph 1 has edges: (4-0), (4-2), (2-0), (2-1), (1-3), (0-3)\n   - Graph 2 has edges: (0-4), (0-3), (0-2), (3-1), (1-2), (2-4)\n\n3. Structure comparison:\n   - Graph 1 forms a different pattern with node 0 connected to nodes 4, 2, and 3\n   - Graph 2 has node 0 connected to nodes 4, 3, and 2\n   - The overall connectivity pattern is different between the graphs\n\n4. Final decision:\n   - While the nodes are the same, the edge connections form different patterns\n   - Therefore, these graphs are not isomorphic and do not match"
