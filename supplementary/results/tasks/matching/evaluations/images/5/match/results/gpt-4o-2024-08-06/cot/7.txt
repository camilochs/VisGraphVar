Edges: Both graphs have the following connections: \n   - Node 0 connects to Node 2 and Node 3.\n   - Node 1 connects to Node 4.\n   - Node 2 connects to Node 3.\n   - Node 0 connects to Node 1.\n4. Edge Weights: Both graphs do not display any weights, indicating weights are uniform or non-existent.\n\nAll components, including nodes and connections, align across both graphs. Therefore, the graphs match."
