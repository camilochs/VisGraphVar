   "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 5 nodes each (labeled 0-4)\n2. Node Labels: Both graphs contain the same set of node labels (0,1,2,3,4)\n3. Structure Analysis:\n   - Both are linear paths\n   - Graph 1 goes from node 4→1→2→3→0\n   - Graph 2 goes from node 0→3→2→1→4\n   - While the direction appears reversed, the structure is identical\n4. Edges:\n   - Both graphs have 4 edges connecting 5 nodes\n   - Each node (except endpoints) has exactly two connections\n   - Edge weights appear to be uniform in both graphs\n\nConclusion: The graphs are isomorphic - they represent the same structure but with nodes arranged in reverse order. Therefore, they match."
