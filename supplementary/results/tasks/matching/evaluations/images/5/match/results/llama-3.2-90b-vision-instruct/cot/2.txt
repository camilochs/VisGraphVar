**Step 1: Compare Node Counts and Labels**

Graph 1 has 4 nodes with labels 0, 1, 2, and 3. Graph 2 also has 4 nodes but with labels 0, 1, 2, and 4. The node counts match, but the labels do not fully align.

**Step 2: Evaluate Connections or Edges**

Graph 1 shows connections between nodes 0 and 1, 1 and 2, and 2 and 3. Graph 2 displays connections between nodes 0 and 1, 1 and 2, and 2 and 4. The connections in Graph 1 do not mirror those in Graph 2, specifically due to the difference in the last node's label and connection.

**Conclusion**

Given that both the node labels and connection patterns between the two graphs do not match exactly, we conclude that the graphs do not match.

**Response in JSON Format:**

```json
{
  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "Both graphs have the same number of nodes but differ in label assignment (Graph 1 uses 0, 1, 2, 3, while Graph 2 uses 0, 1, 2, 4). Additionally, the pattern of connections between nodes does not align, leading to the conclusion that the graphs do not match."
