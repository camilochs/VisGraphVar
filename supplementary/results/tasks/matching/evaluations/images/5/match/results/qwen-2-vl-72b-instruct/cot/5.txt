   "analysis": "The node counts and labels are the same in both graphs, but the connections (edges) differ. Graph 1 has connections between nodes 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, and 3-4. Graph 2 has connections between nodes 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, and 1-2. The connection between 3-4 in Graph 1 is missing in Graph 2, and the connection between 1-2 in Graph 2 is missing in Graph 1. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
