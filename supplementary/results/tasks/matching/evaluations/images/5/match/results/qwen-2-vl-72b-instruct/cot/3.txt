   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match because they have different structures. In Graph 1, there are two connections: a connection between node 0 and node 4, and a connection between node 2 and node 4. In Graph 2, there are three connections: a connection between node 0 and node 4, a connection between node 4 and node 2, and a connection between node 1 and node 3. The presence of the additional connection between node 4 and node 2 in Graph 2 breaks the matching condition."
