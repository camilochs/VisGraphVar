**Graph Comparison Analysis**

To determine if the two given graph images match, we need to examine their structures, node connections, and any weights present.

**Graph Structures:**

*   Both graphs have four nodes each.
*   The node labels in Graph 1 are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
*   The node labels in Graph 2 are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Node Connections:**

*   In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4. Node 2 is also connected to node 4.
*   In Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. Node 2 is also connected to node 4.

**Weights:**

*   Graph 1 does not explicitly show weights on its edges.
*   Graph 2 does not explicitly show weights on its edges.

**Comparison Conclusion:**

Although both graphs have the same number of nodes with similar labels, their connection patterns differ. Specifically, in Graph 1, node 0 is connected to node 4, whereas in Graph 2, node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 2 is connected to node 4. These differences indicate that the two graphs do not match in terms of structure and connectivity.

**JSON Response:**
