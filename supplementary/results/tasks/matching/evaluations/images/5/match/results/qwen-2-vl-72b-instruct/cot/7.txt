{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Upon comparing the two graphs, it is evident that there are inconsistencies. In Graph 1, nodes 1 and 4 are connected, while in Graph 2, nodes 1 and 4 are not connected. This disparity in connections is a clear indication that the graphs do not align. Additionally, there are varying colors for the labels in the two graphs â€“ Graph 1 has blue labels, whereas Graph 2 has green labels. Other than the color disparity, the label text for nodes 0, 2, and 3 remains the same in both graphs. However, the differences in the connections are sufficient to conclude that the two graphs do not match."
