**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1.  **Node Analysis (Colors and Labels):**

    Comparing the graphs, we can see that Graph 1 has four nodes (0, 1, 2, and 3), colored in two different ways (blue and none). Graph 2 also has four nodes (0, 1, 2, and 3), but they are colored differently (green). The labels for the nodes in both graphs are the same, except for the color representation. This difference in color does not affect the structural comparison.
2.  **Connection/Edge Analysis:**

    Both graphs have exactly two edges connecting node 0 and node 2 and nodes 1 and 2. None of the edges in either graph have weights assigned. This indicates that the connectivity pattern between the nodes is identical in both graphs.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the node labelling and edge composition, we conclude that the two graphs structurally match despite differences in color. All nodes and edges align perfectly, indicating a structural match.
