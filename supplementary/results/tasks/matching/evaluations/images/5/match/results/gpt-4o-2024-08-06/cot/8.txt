   "analysis": "Step 1: Compare node counts. Both Graph 1 and Graph 2 have 5 nodes. Step 2: Compare node labels. Both graphs have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Step 3: Compare edges. Both graphs have edges (0-4), (1-4), (2-3), and (3-4). Step 4: Compare edge weights. Both graphs have consistent weights across edges, despite different colors. Since all elements align, the graphs match."
