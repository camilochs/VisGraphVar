Node Labels: Comparing the nodes, the labels do not match between the two graphs.\n   - Graph 1 nodes are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, while\n   - Graph 2 nodes are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n3. Node Connectivity: The way the nodes are connected is different in both graphs.\n   - In Graph 1, the nodes are connected in a linear sequence: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.\n   - In Graph 2, the nodes are also connected linearly: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, but the connections may include varying weights, not explicitly shown.\nConsidering the differences in node labels and connectivity order and pattern, the final decision is: these graphs do not match."
