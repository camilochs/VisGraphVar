Solution to Compare Two Graphs and Identify Matching Structure:

There are no images of the graphs in the prompt; however, here's a Python solution with explanation of how a matching algorithm would be implemented:

### Matching Graphs Solution

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create empty directed graphs
def create_graph(weights=None):
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    G.add_edges_from(weights)
    return G

# Function to compare two graphs based on their structure and edge weights
def compare_graphs(graph1, graph2):
    try:
        # Check for identical structure (edges)
        if (nx.to_dict_of_lists(graph1) != nx.to_dict_of_lists(graph2)):
            return {
                "match": "no",
                "analysis": "Graphs have different structures."
            }

        # Compare edge weights
        for source, destination, attr in graph1.edges(data=True):
            weight1 = attr.get('weight', None)
            weight2 = graph2[source][destination].get('weight', None)
            if weight1 != weight2:
                return {
                    "match": "no",
                    "analysis": "Graphs have different edge weights."
                }
    except nx.NetworkXError:
        return {
            "match": "no",
            "analysis": "Invalid graph or comparison error."
        }

    return {
        "match": "yes",
        "analysis": "The graphs are a match based on their structure and edge weights."
    }
```

### Example Usage:

```python
# Create empty directed graphs with edge weights
graph1 = create_graph([(1, 2, {'weight': 2}), (2, 3, {'weight': 3}), (3, 1, {'weight': 4}), (3, 4, {'weight': 0})])
graph2 = create_graph([(1, 2, {'weight': 2}), (2, 3, {'weight': 3}), (3, 1, {'weight': 4}), (3, 4, {'weight': 0})])    # Compare the two graphs
result = compare_graphs(graph1, graph2)
print(result)
# A sample graph with a matching structure
```

### Answer:

```JSON
{
    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "The graphs are a match based on their structure and edge weights."
}
```

This algorithm works in `O(n + m)` time where `n` is the number of vertices and `m` is the number of edges in the networks. Note that the NetworkX library is used for Network manipulation and Matplotlib for the display, so you may need to `pip install networkx matplotlib` if you haven't already.
