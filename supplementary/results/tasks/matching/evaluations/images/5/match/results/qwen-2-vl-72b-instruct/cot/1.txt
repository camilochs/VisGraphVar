{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match because they have different connectivity. In Graph 1, nodes 2 and 3 are connected, and nodes 3 and 1 are connected. In Graph 2, nodes 3 and 2 are connected, but there is no connection between nodes 1 and 3. Additionally, the weights of the edges are different: in Graph 1, the edge between nodes 2 and 3 has a weight of 4, while in Graph 2, the edge between nodes 3 and 2 has a weight of 3. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
