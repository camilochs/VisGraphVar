  "analysis": "1. **Node Count and Labels:** Both graphs have 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. This check passes.\n2. **Edge Comparison:**\n   - Graph 1 has edges (4, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0).  These represent connections between the sequentially labeled nodes.\n   - Graph 2 has edges (0, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 4). These also connect nodes but in a different order than Graph 1. Because the graphs are undirected in this case, we can reverse the connections for comparison, so Graph 2 is (3,0), (2,3), (1,2), and (4,1). Comparing edges, (4,1) matches, but (1,2) in Graph 1 does not match (2,3) in Graph 2 and so on. Therefore, not all edges from Graph 1 are present in Graph 2.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the edge sets are not identical the graphs do not match."
