**Graph Analysis: Graph 1 and Graph 2**

To determine if two graphs match, a component-by-component comparison can be performed. This analysis will focus on node counts and labels, and connections or edges including any weights associated with them.

### Node Counts and Labels

*   **Graph 1:**
    *   The graph has four nodes, each with a unique label: 0, 1, 2, and 3.
*   **Graph 2:**
    *   This graph also has four nodes, labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.

### Edges and Weights

*   **Graph 1:**
    *   The graph contains three edges: (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3).
    *   There are no weights associated with the edges in this graph.
*   **Graph 2:**
    *   The graph also has three edges: (0,1), (0,3), and (0,2).
    *   There are no weights associated with these edges.

### Comparison and Conclusion

Both graphs have the same number of nodes and identical labels. The edges in both graphs are connected to the same nodes, although they may be represented in a different order. Since the order of edges does not affect the structure of the graph, both graphs can be considered to have the same connections. With neither graph having weights, there is no difference in edge weights between the two graphs.
