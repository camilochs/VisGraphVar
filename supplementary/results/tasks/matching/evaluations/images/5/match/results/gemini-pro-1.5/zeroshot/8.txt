  "analysis": "Both graphs have the same nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and the same edges connecting those nodes: (1, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (3, 2), meaning they have the same structure.  The visualization is different, such as in node and edge colors and layout, but the underlying graph structure is identical."
