   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "The graphs are isomorphic. Both graphs have 5 nodes and 6 edges with identical connection patterns. While the node labels and visual layout differ between the two graphs, the underlying structure is the same. Each graph has a central node (0 in Graph 1, 0 in Graph 2) connected to all other nodes, and the peripheral nodes form the same connection pattern. The only difference is the visual representation and node numbering, but structurally they are equivalent."
