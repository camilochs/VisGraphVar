   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 5 nodes labeled 0-4, so this matches.\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\nGraph 1:\n- Node 0 connects to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4\n- Node 1 connects to nodes 2 and 3\n- Forms a more interconnected structure with triangular patterns\n\nGraph 2:\n- Node 0 connects only to node 4\n- Node 1 connects to nodes 2 and 3\n- Node 2 connects to node 0\n- Node 3 connects to node 0\n- Forms a more linear/chain-like structure\n\n3. Overall Structure:\n- Graph 1 has more connections and forms a different topology with triangular patterns\n- Graph 2 has fewer connections and forms a different shape\n\nConclusion: While the graphs have the same nodes, they have different edge connections and overall structures, therefore they do not match."
