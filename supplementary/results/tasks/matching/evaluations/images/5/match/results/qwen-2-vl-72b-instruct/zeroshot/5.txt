   "analysis": "The two graphs have different structures and node connections. In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. In Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4, but the connections between these nodes are different. For example, in Graph 1, nodes 2 and 1, and nodes 3 and 1 are connected, while in Graph 2, nodes 2 and 4 are connected. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
