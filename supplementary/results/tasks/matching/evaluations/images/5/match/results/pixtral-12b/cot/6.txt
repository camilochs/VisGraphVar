Node comparison:\n    - Graph 1 has nodes with labels 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n    - Graph 2 has nodes with labels 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    - Node 5 in Graph 1 does not appear in Graph 2.\n2. Node connection comparison:\n    - In Graph 1, nodes 0 and 2 are connected, nodes 2 and 1 are connected, and nodes 1 and 3 are connected.\n    - In Graph 2, nodes 0 and 2 are connected, nodes 2 and 1 are connected, and nodes 1 and 3 are connected.\n    - There appears to be a clear correlation in the connections of nodes 0, 1, and 2 in both graphs.\n3. Overall node and connection evaluation:\n    - Graph 1 has an additional node (5) without a corresponding node or connection in Graph 2.\n    - The structure and connections of other nodes are identical except for the absence of node 5 in Graph 2.\nTherefore, the graphs do not match."
