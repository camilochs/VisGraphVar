**Step 1: Analyze the structure of Graph 1.**

Graph 1 has four nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 4. Edge connections are as follows:

-   Edge from node 0 to node 1
-   Edge from node 0 to node 2
-   Edge from node 0 to node 4
-   Edge from node 2 to node 1
-   Edge from node 4 to node 3

**Step 2: Analyze the structure of Graph 2.**

Graph 2 also has four nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3. Edge connections are as follows:

-   Edge from node 0 to node 1
-   Edge from node 3 to node 1
-   Edge from node 3 to node 0
-   Edge from node 2 to node 0

**Step 3. Compare Graph 1 and Graph 2 for structural similarity.**

Both have four nodes, but their connections and labeling differ. The presence of a node labeled 4 in Graph 1 and its absence in Graph 2, along with the different connection patterns, indicates a structural mismatch.

**Conclusion:** 

Given the structural differences, including edge connections and node labels, the two graphs do not match.

**JSON response:**

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Although both graphs have the same number of nodes, significant structural differences exist, including node labels and edge connections, which preclude a match between them."
