    "analysis": "The graphs are different in several aspects: Graph 1 has 5 nodes (0,1,2,3,4) with node 3 being isolated, and connections forming a tree-like structure from node 0. Graph 2 also has 5 nodes (0,1,2,3,4) but has a different connection pattern, with node 3 being isolated and the remaining nodes forming a different arrangement of connections. The edge patterns and overall structure are not identical between the two graphs, making them non-matching graphs."
