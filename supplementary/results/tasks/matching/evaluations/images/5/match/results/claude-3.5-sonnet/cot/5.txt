   "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 5 nodes (labeled 0-4)\n2. Edge Analysis:\n   - Both graphs have 6 edges\n   - Graph 1 connections:\n     * 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 1-2, 3-4\n   - Graph 2 connections:\n     * 0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 0-4, 1-2, 3-4\n3. Structure: Both graphs show the same topological structure, just with different visual layouts\n4. The only difference is the visual representation (blue vs green nodes, and different spatial arrangements), but structurally they are identical\n5. No weights are shown on either graph, so edge weights are not a factor\n\nConclusion: The graphs are isomorphic - they represent the same graph structure with different layouts."
