I'm sorry, but I cannot visualize the given images to compare the graph structures, node connections, or weights. As a text-based AI model, I don't have the capability to access or analyze visual content, including images. 

However, I can provide you with the expected JSON output format:
```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Unable to compare graphs due to inability to access visual content."
}
```
