   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "Both graphs are linear chains with 5 nodes each, numbered from 0 to 4. While they appear visually reversed (Graph 1 goes from bottom to top and Graph 2 goes from top to bottom), their structural connectivity is identical. Each node is connected to exactly one other node (except for end nodes), forming a simple path. The node numbering is simply inverted between the two graphs but the underlying structure is the same."
