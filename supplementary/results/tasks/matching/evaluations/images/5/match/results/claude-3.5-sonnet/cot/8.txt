    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "1. Node Count Check:\n- Both graphs have exactly 5 nodes\n- Both graphs have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\n- Both graphs have 4 edges\n- Both graphs have the following connections:\n  * Node 4 connects to Node 0\n  * Node 4 connects to Node 1\n  * Node 4 connects to Node 3\n  * Node 3 connects to Node 2\n\n3. Structure Analysis:\n- Both graphs follow the same tree-like structure\n- Node 4 serves as a central hub in both graphs\n- The arrangement forms identical topologies despite different visual layouts\n\n4. Visual Differences:\n- While the layouts appear different (one is more vertical, the other more spread out)\n- The underlying structure and connections are identical\n\nConclusion: The graphs match perfectly in terms of nodes, connections, and overall topology, despite different visual presentations."
