   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match because, although they have the same number of nodes and the same labels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), the connections (edges) between the nodes are different. In Graph 1, the connections form a pentagon with a diagonal from node 0 to node 4. In contrast, in Graph 2, the connections do not form a pentagon and the diagonal is from node 0 to node 4 but in a different orientation and with a different layout of the other connections."
