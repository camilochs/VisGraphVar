### Analysis:

1. **Node Count and Labels**:
   - Both graphs have six nodes each, labeled from 0 to 5.
   - This makes it seem like they could be identical, but node order and connections matter.

2. **Graph 1 Node Arrangement**:
   - Node 0 connects with nodes 1, 2, and 3.
   - Node 3 connects with node 2 and 4.
   - Node 4 does not connect to any other nodes and is a leaf node.
   - Node 1 connects to nodes 0 and 3.
   - Node 2 connects to nodes 0 and 3.
   - Node 3 connects to nodes 0, 1, and 2.

3. **Graph 2 Node Arrangement**:
   - Node 0 connects with nodes 3, 4, and 5.
   - Node 4 does not connect to any other nodes and is a leaf node.
   - Node 5 connects with nodes 1, 3, 4, and 2.
   - Node 3 connects with nodes 0, 2, and 5.
   - Node 2 connects with nodes 1 and 5.

4. **Edge Connections**:
   - Graph 1: Edges are {0-1, 0-2, 0-3, 1-3, 2-0, 2-3, 3-0, 3-1, 3-2, 3-4}.
   - Graph 2: Edges are {0-3, 0-4, 0-5, 1-5, 2-5, 3-0, 3-2, 3-5, 4-5, 5-1, 5-2, 5-4}.

5. **EdgeWeights and Triangle Structures**:
   - Despite similar structural connections, the arrangement and triangle formations differ.
   - This visual difference confirms that, despite having the same nodes and similar edges, the connection structures do not match perfectly.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Visual verification and comparison of node connections and order confirm the graphs are not identical.
