**Graph Analysis**

To determine if the two graphs match, we will analyze their structures, node connections, and weights.

**Graph 1:**

*   The graph has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.
*   There are 3 edges connecting the nodes: (0, 1), (1, 2), and (0, 2).
*   No weights are specified for the edges.

**Graph 2:**

*   The graph has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.
*   There are 3 edges connecting the nodes: (0, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 0).
*   No weights are specified for the edges.

**Comparison:**

*   Both graphs have the same number of nodes (4) and the same node labels (0, 1, 2, and 3).
*   The edge connections differ between the two graphs. Graph 1 has edges (0, 1), (1, 2), and (0, 2), while Graph 2 has edges (0, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 0).

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the two graphs do not match due to differences in their edge connections.
