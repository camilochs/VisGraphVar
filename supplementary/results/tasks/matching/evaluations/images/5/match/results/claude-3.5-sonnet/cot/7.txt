   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "1. Node Count and Labels: Both graphs contain 5 nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4\n2. Node Positions: While the layouts appear slightly different (one in blue, one in green), the topological structure is identical\n3. Edge Connections:\n   - Node 0 connects to nodes 1,2,3 in both graphs\n   - Node 1 connects to nodes 0,4 in both graphs\n   - Node 2 connects to nodes 0,3 in both graphs\n   - Node 3 connects to nodes 0,2 in both graphs\n   - Node 4 connects only to node 1 in both graphs\n4. Edge Count: Both graphs have the same number of edges (6)\n5. Overall Structure: Despite different visual presentations (color and exact positioning), the graphs are topologically identical in terms of nodes and their connections\n\nConclusion: The graphs match as they have identical node counts, labels, and connection patterns."
