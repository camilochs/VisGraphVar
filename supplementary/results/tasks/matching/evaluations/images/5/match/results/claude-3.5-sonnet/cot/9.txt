Node Position Analysis:\n- Graph 1 has a connected component with nodes 0,1,2 in a triangular formation\n- Graph 2 has a connected component with nodes 0,1,2 in a triangular formation\n- Nodes 3 and 4 are isolated in both graphs but in different positions\n\n3. Edge Comparison:\n- Graph 1 has edges connecting nodes 0-1-2 in a triangle\n- Graph 2 has edges connecting nodes 0-1-2 in a Y-shape (star configuration)\n- The edge configuration is different between the graphs\n\n4. Final Decision:\nWhile the graphs have the same number of nodes and labels, they are not isomorphic because:\n- The edge patterns are different (triangle vs. Y-shape)\n- Graph 1 has 3 edges forming a cycle\n- Graph 2 has 2 edges forming a star pattern\nTherefore, these graphs do not match."
