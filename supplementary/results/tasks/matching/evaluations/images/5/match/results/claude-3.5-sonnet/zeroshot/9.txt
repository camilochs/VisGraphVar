   "analysis": "The graphs have significant structural differences. Graph 1 shows isolated nodes (3 and 4) and a connected component of three nodes (0,1,2) forming a triangle. Graph 2 also has isolated nodes (3 and 4) but its connected component (nodes 0,1,2) forms a Y-shape or star pattern rather than a triangle. While both graphs have the same number of nodes (5), their connection patterns are different."
