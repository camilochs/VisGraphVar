  "analysis": "Graph 1 has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Graph 2 has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Both graphs have the same number of nodes and the same labels. In Graph 1, nodes 0, 1, and 2 are connected. Nodes 3 and 4 are isolated. In Graph 2, nodes 0, 1, and 2 are connected, and Nodes 3 and 4 are isolated. While the node connections within the triangle in graph 1 appear the same but are not explicitly defined, the edges in graph 2 show a connection between node 0 and 1, node 1 and 2, and node 0 and 2.  Due to this explicit difference in defined edges, the graphs do not match."
