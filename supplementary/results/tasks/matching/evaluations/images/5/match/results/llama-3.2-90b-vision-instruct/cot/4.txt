**Graph Comparison Analysis**

To determine if the two graphs match, we will compare each node label from the first graph with the corresponding node label in the second graph. We will also examine each edge to confirm the connections and their weights are identical between the two graphs.

**Step 1: Node Count and Label Comparison**

*   **Graph 1:**
    *   Node 1 is labeled "1".
    *   Node 2 is labeled "2".
    *   Node 3 is labeled "3".
    *   Node 4 is labeled "4".
*   **Graph 2:**
    *   Node 1 is labeled "1".
    *   Node 2 is labeled "2".
    *   Node 3 is labeled "3".
    *   Node 4 is labeled "4".

Upon comparing the node labels, it is evident that both graphs have the same number of nodes and the node labels match exactly.

**Step 2: Edge Comparison**

*   **Graph 1 Edges:**
    *   An edge connects Node 1 to Node 0 with no weight specified.
    *   An edge connects Node 2 to Node 0 with no weight specified.
    *   An edge connects Node 3 to Node 0 with no weight specified.
    *   An edge connects Node 4 to Node 0 with no weight specified.
*   **Graph 2 Edges:**
    *   An edge connects Node 1 to Node 0 with a weight of 1.
    *   An edge connects Node 2 to Node 3 with no weight specified.
    *   An edge connects Node 3 to Node 0 with a weight of 3.
    *   An edge connects Node 4 to Node 2 with a weight of 2.
    *   An edge connects Node 0 to Node 4 with a weight of 4.

The edges in the two graphs do not match because:

*   In Graph 1, there are edges directly from Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 to Node 0, whereas in Graph 2, the edges are distributed differently with some nodes having direct connections to Node 0 and other connections not present in Graph 1.
*   The weights on the edges in Graph 2 are not present in Graph 1, indicating a significant difference in how the graphs are structured.

**Conclusion**

Given the discrepancies in the edge connections and the presence of weights in Graph 2 that are not accounted for in Graph 1, we conclude that the two graphs do not match.
