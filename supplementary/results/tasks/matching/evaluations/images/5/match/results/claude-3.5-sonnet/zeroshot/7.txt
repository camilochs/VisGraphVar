    "match": "yes",
    "analysis": "The two graphs are identical in structure. Both contain 5 nodes (labeled 0-4) with the same connection pattern: a triangle formed by nodes 0, 2, and 3 at the top, and a linear path from node 0 through node 1 to node 4 at the bottom. The only difference is the visual presentation - Graph 1 uses blue nodes and gray edges, while Graph 2 uses green nodes and orange edges. The underlying topology and connectivity remain the same."
