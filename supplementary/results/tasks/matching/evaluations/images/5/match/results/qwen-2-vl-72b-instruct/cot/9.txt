   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match. Upon comparison, the node counts and labels are different. Graph 1 has three nodes with labels 0, 1, and 2, while Graph 2 also has three nodes but with labels 0, 1, and 2, which are the same. However, the connections between the nodes are different. In Graph 1, nodes 1 and 2 are connected to node 0, but in Graph 2, nodes 1 and 2 are connected by an orange line, indicating a different type of connection or weight. Additionally, there are individual nodes in both graphs with labels 3 and 4, but the overall structure and connections of the main graphs do not align, hence they do not match."
