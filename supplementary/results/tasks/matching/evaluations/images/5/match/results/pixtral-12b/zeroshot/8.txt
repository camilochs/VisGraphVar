   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match. While both graphs have nodes labeled 1, 3, and 4, the node connections and structure differ. In Graph 1, Node 0 and Node 2 are connected to Node 3 and Node 4 respectively to form a network-like structure. In Graph 2, Node 1 and Node 4 are directly connected to Node 5, and Node 5 is also connected to Node 2 and Node 3. The arrangement and connectivity patterns are different."
