Node labels and counts:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 0\n   - Graph 2 has nodes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 0\n   Difference: Graph 2 has node 5 instead of node 4 from Graph 1.\n2. Edges/Connections:\n   - Graph 1 has edges between: 1-4, 2-3, 3-4, 4-0\n   - Graph 2 has edges between: 1-5, 5-3, 3-0, 5-0\n   Difference: The structure and connections are different, and node 4 in Graph 1 is replaced by node 5 in Graph 2 with different connections.\n   Overall, both the node set and edge set do not match directly.\nConclusion: The graphs do not match."
