   "analysis": "Step-by-step explanation:\n1. Compare node counts and labels:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.\n   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.\n   Since both graphs have the same nodes, move to the next step.\n2. Compare the connections (edges):\n   - In Graph 1, node 1 is connected to node 4. In Graph 2, node 1 is connected to node 4.\n   - In Graph 1, node 2 is connected to node 3, node 9, and node 1. In Graph 2, node 2 is connected to node 3 and node 9.\n   - In Graph 1, node 3 is connected to node 2 and node 9. In Graph 2, node 3 is connected to node 2 and node 9.\n   - In Graph 1, node 4 is connected only to node 1. In Graph 2, node 4 is connected only to node 1.\n   - In Graph 1, node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 1. In Graph 2, node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.\n   These connections are not identical between the graphs, indicating they do not match.\nConclusion: The graphs do not match due to different connections between nodes."
