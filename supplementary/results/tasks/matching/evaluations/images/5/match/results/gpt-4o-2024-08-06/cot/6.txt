Graph 1 edges: (0-1), (0-2), (1-2), (2-4).\n4. Graph 2 edges: (0-1), (0-2), (1-2), (2-4).\n5. Graph 1 does not have weights on the edges.\n6. Graph 2 does show weights (implied by colored edges) but specifics are unknown.\n7. Overall connection structure seems similar at first glance but weights are undefined in Graph 1, leading to mismatch with Graph 2.\n8. Conclusion: Graphs do not match due to differences in edge weights."
