**Graph 1:**

*   Node count: 4
*   Node labels: 0, 1, 2, 4
*   Edges and weights:
    *   (0, 2): 0
    *   (2, 4): 2
    *   (1, 3): None

**Graph 2:**

*   Node count: 4
*   Node labels: 0, 2, 3, 4
*   Edges and weights:
    *   (0, 4): 0
    *   (4, 2): 4
    *   (1, 3): None

**Comparison:**

*   **Node Count and Labels:** Both graphs have 4 nodes, but the labels do not match exactly. Graph 1 has labels 0, 1, 2, 4, while Graph 2 has labels 0, 2, 3, 4. This discrepancy indicates different node configurations.
*   **Edges and Weights:** The edges and weights in the two graphs are also distinct. Graph 1 contains edges (0, 2) with weight 0 and (2, 4) with weight 2, whereas Graph 2 includes edges (0, 4) with weight 0 and (4, 2) with weight 4. These differences signify distinct connectivity patterns.

**Conclusion:**

Given the disparities in node labels and edge weights, along with the presence of unmatched edges in both graphs, it is evident that Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match.
