    "analysis": "While both graphs contain the same number of nodes (5 nodes labeled 0-4), their connection structures differ significantly. In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4 forming a central connection point, while node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. In Graph 2, node 0 serves as a different type of hub, connecting to nodes 2, 3, and 4, but the overall pattern of connections is different, particularly in how nodes 1, 2, and 3 are connected. The edge arrangements create distinct topological structures between the two graphs."
