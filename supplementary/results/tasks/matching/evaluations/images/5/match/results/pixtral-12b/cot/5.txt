Node count and labels:\n   - Graph 1 has 5 nodes (4, 3, 2, 2, 0).\n   - Graph 2 has 5 nodes (0, 1, 2, 2, 3).\n   This includes different node labels which introduces the first major difference.\n   Therefore, node counts and labels do not match.\n2. Edges:\n   - Graph 1 has edges connecting nodes 4 to 0, 4 to 2, 4 to 3, 3 to 0, 3 to 2,\n     0 to 2, and 2 to 0.\n   - Graph 2 has edges connecting nodes 0 to 1, 0 to 2, 0 to 3, and 2 to 3.\n   The structure and connectivity are different.\nTherefore, the edge configurations do not match.\nBased on the above differences in nodes and edges, the two graphs do not match."
