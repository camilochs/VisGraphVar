Edges: \n   - Graph 1 has edges 0-1, 0-2, 0-4, 1-3, 2-3, 2-4.\n   - Graph 2 has edges 0-1, 0-2, 0-4, 1-3, 2-3, 2-4.\n4. All edges correspond directly with each other, with the same connections in both graphs.\n5. No edge weights are present in either graph.\nConclusion: All elements align, so the graphs match."
