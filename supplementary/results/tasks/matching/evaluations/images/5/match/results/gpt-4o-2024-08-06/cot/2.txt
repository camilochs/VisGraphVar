   "match": "yes",
   "analysis": "Step 1: Node Count - Both graphs have 5 nodes indicating they may match. Step 2: Node Labels - Both graphs have nodes labeled from 0 to 4, confirming node labels align. Step 3: Edges - Graph 1 has edges (0-3), (1-2), (2-1), and (3-4). Graph 2 has edges (0-3), (1-2), (2-1), and (3-4). The edges are identical in both graphs with parallel connections, confirming a match. Step 4: Weights - No weights are displayed; we assume uniform weights or unweighted edges, a match by default. Conclusion: Both graphs match completely in nodes, labels, and edges."
