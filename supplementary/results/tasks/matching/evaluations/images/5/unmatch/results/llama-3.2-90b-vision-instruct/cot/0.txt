**Graph Comparison Analysis**

To determine if the two graphs match, we will analyze each component of the graphs step by step.

**Node Comparison**

*   Graph 1 has 4 nodes with labels: 0, 1, 2, 3
*   Graph 2 has 4 nodes with labels: 0, 1, 2, 3

Both graphs have the same number of nodes with identical labels.

**Edge Comparison**

*   Graph 1 has the following edges:
    *   (0, 1) with no explicit weight
    *   (0, 2) with no explicit weight
    *   (0, 3) with no explicit weight
    *   (1, 0) with no explicit weight
    *   (2, 3) with no explicit weight
    *   (3, 4) with no explicit weight
*   Graph 2 has the following edges:
    *   (1, 0) with no explicit weight
    *   (2, 4) with no explicit weight
    *   (3, 0) with no explicit weight
    *   (3, 4) with no explicit weight
    *   (4, 2) with no explicit weight

Graphs 1 and 2 do not have the same edges. Graph 1 has edges (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (2, 3) which are not present in Graph 2. Graph 2 has edges (1, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), and (4, 2) which are not present in Graph 1.

**Conclusion**

The graphs do not match because they do not have the same edges.

**JSON Response**

```json
{
  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "The graphs do not match because they do not have the same edges. Although they have the same number of nodes with identical labels, the differences in edges and their labels (or weights) mean that they are structurally different. This difference is critical in determining graph equivalence or isomorphism. Therefore, based on both node and edge comparisons, the two graphs do not match."
