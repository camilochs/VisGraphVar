    "analysis": "1. Node Count Comparison:\n- Both graphs have 5 nodes each\n- Graph 1 has nodes labeled: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n- Graph 2 has nodes labeled: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n2. Edge Comparison:\n- Graph 1 forms a square with a diagonal branch (5 edges)\n- Graph 2 forms a different structure with branches (5 edges)\n\n3. Structure Differences:\n- Graph 1 has a square base with node 2 extending from node 1\n- Graph 2 has a more tree-like structure with node 1 as root\n\n4. Connection Patterns:\n- Graph 1: 0-3-1-4-0 forms a cycle, with 2 connected to 1\n- Graph 2: 1 connects to 0, 4, and 2; 2 connects to 3\n\nConclusion: While both graphs have the same number of nodes and edges, their structural arrangements and connectivity patterns are completely different, therefore they do not match."
