   "analysis": "The two graphs have different structures. Graph 1 has a node 3 connected to a node 1, and nodes 0, 2, and 4 form a line. In contrast, Graph 2 has a completely different structure with no node 1 connected to node 3, and the nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 form a different pattern. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
