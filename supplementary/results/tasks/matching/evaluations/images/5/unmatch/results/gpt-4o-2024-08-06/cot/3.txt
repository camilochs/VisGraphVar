Edges:\n   - Graph 1 has edges (0-1), (0-3), (0-4), (4-2), (3-4).\n   - Graph 2 has edges (0-1), (0-3), (0-4), (4-2), (3-4).\n4. Edge weights: No edge weights are displayed, implying all are equal if existent.\n5. Conclusion: All components match exactly in terms of nodes and edges connecting them. Thus, the graphs are identical in structure."
