Graph 1 consists of a structure with vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 3 (which connects to 0, 1, 2, and 4) forming a complex shape whereas Graph 2 consists of vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 with different connections forming a different shape. The connections and arrangement of vertices are distinct between the two graphs."
