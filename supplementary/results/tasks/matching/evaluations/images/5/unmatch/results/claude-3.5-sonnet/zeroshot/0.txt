    "analysis": "While both graphs have the same number of nodes (5) and appear to be similar in overall structure, they have several key differences: 1) The node numbering is different between the graphs, 2) The edge connections follow different patterns - Graph 1 has node 3 connected to nodes 1, 0, and 2, while Graph 2 has node 4 connected to nodes 2, 3, and 1. Even accounting for possible isomorphism, the underlying structure is not identical between the two graphs."
