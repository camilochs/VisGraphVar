**Analysis of Graphs**

Upon examining the two graph images, it is evident that they do not match. The graphs have identical structures and node connections, but they differ in their weights.

**Key Similarities and Differences**

*   **Structure:** Both graphs have the same structure, with four nodes connected by three edges.
*   **Node Connections:** Both graphs have the same node connections, with node 1 connected to nodes 2 and 3, node 2 connected to nodes 1 and 4, node 3 connected to nodes 1 and 4, and node 4 connected to nodes 2 and 3.
*   **Weights:** The weights of the edges differ by 1 between the two graphs. Graph 1 has edge weights 1, 2, and 3 throughout, while Graph 2 starts with weights 1, 0, 2 and ends with 3.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the two graph images do not match due to the difference in their weights. Therefore, the answer is no, they do not match.
