   "analysis": "The nodes in Graph 1 are labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, while the nodes in Graph 2 are labeled 0, 3, and 4. The node labels do not match. Additionally, the edges in Graph 1 connect nodes (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4), while the edges in Graph 2 connect nodes (0, 3) and (3, 4). The edge connections do not match either. Therefore, the two graphs do not match."
