   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs have different structures and connections. In Graph 1, the nodes are connected in a vertical, linear sequence from node 1 to node 4. In Graph 2, the nodes are connected in a diagonal, linear sequence from node 5 to node 8. Additionally, the color coding and arrangement of the graphs are different, with Graph 1 using light blue nodes and Graph 2 using green nodes."
}
```

This analysis shows that based on the visual inspection of the structures and node positions, the two graphs do not match.
