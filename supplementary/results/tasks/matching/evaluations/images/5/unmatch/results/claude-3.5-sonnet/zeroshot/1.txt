    "analysis": "The graphs are different in both structure and connectivity. Graph 1 shows a layout with 5 nodes (0-4) arranged in a roughly rectangular shape with a branch to node 2, while Graph 2 shows a different arrangement with 6 nodes (0-4, 9) in a more spread-out pattern. The connection patterns are also different - Graph 1 has edges forming a quadrilateral with an additional branch, while Graph 2 has a more tree-like structure with different node relationships. The node numbering and overall topology are distinct between the two graphs."
