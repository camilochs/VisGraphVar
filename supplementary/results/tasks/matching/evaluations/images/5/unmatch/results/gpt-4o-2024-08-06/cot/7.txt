   "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 5 nodes (labeled 0 through 4).\n2. Node Labels: The node labels in both graphs are the same (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n3. Edges:\n   - Graph 1 has edges (0-1), (0-2), (0-4), and (1-3).\n   - Graph 2 has edges (0-1), (0-3), (1-2), (1-3), and (2-4).\n4. Edge Weights: No weights are visible for either graph, assuming they are unweighted for this comparison.\n5. Mismatch: Graph 1 and Graph 2 have different edges. Specifically, Graph 1 lacks the edges (1-2) and (0-3) present in Graph 2, and Graph 2 lacks the edge (0-4) present in Graph 1.\nConclusion: Due to differing edges, the graphs do not match."
