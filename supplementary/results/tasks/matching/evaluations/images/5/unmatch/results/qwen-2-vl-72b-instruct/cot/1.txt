   "analysis": "The two graphs do not match. Here is the step-by-step comparison:\n\n1. Node counts: Both graphs have five nodes each (nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n2. Node labels: The node labels are the same in both graphs (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n3. Edge connections: The edge connections are different between the two graphs.\n   - Graph 1: edges are (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4).\n   - Graph 2: edges are (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4).\n\nSince the edge connections do not match, the graphs do not match."
