**Graph Comparison and Analysis**

To compare the two graphs, we will break it down into steps:

1. **Node Count and Labels**
   - Graph 1 has 4 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3.
   - Graph 2 has 4 nodes as well, also labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 from bottom to top. Therefore, the graphs match at this level.

2. **Connections or Edges**
   - In Graph 1, node 0 connects to node 1 directly (assuming unweighted edges is inferred).
   - In Graph 2, node 0 (bottom) connects to node 1 (top) with a weight of 1.
   - In Graph 1, node 0 is also connected to node 2.
   - In Graph 2, node 0 (bottom) connects to node 4 (middle), but there's no direct connection from a node labeled '0' to a node labeled '2'. Instead, '0' connects to '4' and '4' connects to '3', which then connects to '2'. Therefore, the connection paths from '0' to '2' do not align between the two graphs.

3. **Conclusion**
   Given that the nodes match in count and labels, but the edges and their weights do not perfectly align (specifically the connection from node '0' to node '2' in Graph 1 versus the indirect path through '4' and '3' to '2' in Graph 2), we conclude the graphs do not match.
