  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "While both graphs have the same number of nodes (5), the connections between the nodes are different. For example, in Graph 1, node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. In Graph 2, node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2, and node 0 is only connected to node 3.  Because the connections differ, the graphs do not match."
