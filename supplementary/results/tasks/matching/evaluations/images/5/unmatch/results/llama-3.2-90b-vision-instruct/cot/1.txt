**Step-by-Step Graph Comparison and Analysis**

### Step 1: Node Count Comparison

* Graph 1: 4 nodes
* Graph 2: 4 nodes

Both graphs have the same number of nodes.

### Step 2: Node Label Comparison

* Graph 1: Labels: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
* Graph 2: Labels: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

All node labels are identical, although some are reordered across the graphs.

### Step 3: Connection Comparison

* Graph 1:
	+ 0-3
	+ 0-4
	+ 1-3
	+ 1-2
* Graph 2:
	+ 0-1
	+ 0-2
	+ 1-2
	+ 1-3
	+ 1-4

More connections are shown in Graph 2 than Graph 1.

### Step 4: Weight Comparison

* No weights shown in either graph

No weights are on any edges, making the weight comparison conclusion obvious.

```json
{
  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "The two graphs do not match. They share the same four node labels. However, they differ in the sets of connections shown, and they contain no edge weights."
