Evaluate connections and edges:\n   - Graph 1 has connections: 0-1, 1-3, 1-4, 1-2, 2-3\n   - Graph 2 has connections: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4\n3. Consider any weights:\n   - Both graphs do not have weights indicated on edges.\n4. Comparison of complete graph structures:\n   - Graph 1 includes the extra node 5 and different connections.\n5. Based on the differences in node count and connections, the graphs do not match."
