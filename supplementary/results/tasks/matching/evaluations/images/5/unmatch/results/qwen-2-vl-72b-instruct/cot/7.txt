   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The graphs do not match because they have different node labels and connections. Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, while Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 as well, but the connections between the nodes are different. In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4, while in Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3. Additionally, node 1 in Graph 1 is connected to node 3, whereas in Graph 2, node 1 is connected to node 2. These differences in connections indicate that the graphs do not match."
