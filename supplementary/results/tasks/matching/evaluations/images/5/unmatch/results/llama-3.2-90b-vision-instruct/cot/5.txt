**Graph Comparison Analysis**

*   **Node Count**: Both graphs have 5 nodes each.
*   **Node Labels**: The nodes in both graphs are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
*   **Edge Comparison**:
    *   **Edge (0,1)**: Present in both graphs with a weight of 4.
    *   **Edge (0,4)**: Present in both graphs with a weight of 3.
    *   **Edge (1,2)**: Present in both graphs with a weight of 2.
    *   **Edge (1,3)**: Present in both graphs with a weight of 1.
*   **Additional Edges**:
    *   **Edge (2,3)**: Present in Graph 1 with a weight of 1.
    *   **Edge (2,3)**: Not present in Graph 2.
*   **Conclusion**: The graphs do not match because Graph 1 has an additional edge (2,3) that is not present in Graph 2.

**JSON Output**

```json
{
  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "Both graphs have the same number of nodes and labels. However, upon comparing edges, an extra edge (2,3) is found in Graph 1. Therefore, Graph 1 and Graph 2 do not match."
}
