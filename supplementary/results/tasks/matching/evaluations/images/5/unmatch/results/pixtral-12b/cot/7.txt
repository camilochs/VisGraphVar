Let's conduct a step-by-step analysis to determine if the two graphs match.

1. **Node Count and Labels:** 
   - Both graphs have the same nodes with identical labels: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

2. **Edge Count and Structure:**
   - **Graph 1:**
     - Node 0 connects to Node 4.
     - Node 0 forms a triangle with Node 2 and Node 1.
     - Node 1 connects to Node 3.
   - **Graph 2:**
     - Node 0 connects to Node 1.
     - Node 0 forms a triangle with Node 3 and Node 2.
     - Node 1 connects to Node 3.
     - Node 1 connects to Node 4.

3. **Edges Comparison:**
   - The connection between Node 0 and Node 4 exists in Graph 1 but not in Graph 2.
   - The triangle formed in Graph 1 by Node 0, Node 1, and Node 2 is also present in Graph 2.
   - The connection between Node 1 and Node 3 is in both graphs.
   - Graph 2 has additional edges between Node 1 and Node 4, and Node 2 and Node 4, which are absent in Graph 1.

4. **Analysis Conclusion:**
   - Despite having the same set of nodes, the edge structures and certain connections differ between the two graphs.

### Analysis:
- Both graphs have the same nodes with labels {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
- Graph 1 and Graph 2 have some common connections like Node 1 connecting to Node 3.
- There are differences in additional edges present in Graph 2 (Node 1 to Node 4 and Node 2 to Node 4) absent in Graph 1.
- Due to these discrepancies in edges, the two graphs do not match.

### Response:
```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Both graphs have the same nodes with identical labels. However, Graph 2 has additional edges (Node 1 to Node 4 and Node 2 to Node 4) that are not present in Graph 1. This results in different edge structures, leading to the conclusion that the graphs do not match."
