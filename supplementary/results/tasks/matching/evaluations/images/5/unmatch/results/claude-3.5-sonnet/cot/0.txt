Edge comparison:\n   - Both graphs have 6 edges\n   - Graph 1 connections:\n     * 1-3\n     * 3-0\n     * 3-2\n     * 2-4\n     * 4-0\n   - Graph 2 connections:\n     * Same connections but displayed in a different spatial arrangement\n\n3. Structure verification:\n   - Both graphs form the same topology\n   - The relationships between nodes are identical\n   - Only the visual layout differs\n\n4. Final determination:\n   - The graphs are isomorphic - they represent the same structure despite different visual presentations\n   - All nodes have the same connectivity patterns\n   - The relationship between vertices is preserved in both graphs"
