  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "Graph 1 has 5 nodes labeled 0, 2, 3, 4 connected in a chain structure 2--3--4--0. Node 1 exists as a disconnected element. Graph 2 also has 5 nodes, but connected differently. Nodes 0,1,3 and 4 are connected as 3--4--0--1, while node 2 is an isolated node. The connections and structure between the two graphs differ, leading to the conclusion of non-match."
