The final answer is:

```json
{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The two graphs have the same number of nodes (5), but the labels and connections are different. In Graph 1, node 3 is connected to node 0 and node 4, while in Graph 2, node 3 is connected to node 0 and node 2. Additionally, the weights of the edges are different between the two graphs. Therefore, the two graphs do not match." 
}
