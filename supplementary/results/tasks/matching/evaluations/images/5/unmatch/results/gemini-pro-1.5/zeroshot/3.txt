  "analysis": "While both graphs have 5 nodes labeled 0-4, the connections between the nodes are different. For example, in Graph 1, node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3. However, in Graph 2, node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4, while node 3 is only connected to node 0.  Therefore, the graphs are not isomorphic."
