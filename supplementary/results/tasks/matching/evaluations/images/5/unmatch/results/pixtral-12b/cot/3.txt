Node Count and Labels:\n- Graph 1 has 6 nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n- Graph 2 has 5 nodes labeled 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThis shows that the node counts and labels are different, specifically with Graph 2 missing the node labeled '1'.\n\n2. Examination of Connections:\n- Graph 1 has connections: 1-3, 1-5, 3-4, 3-5, 4-6, 5-2.\n- Graph 2 has connections: 5-6, 5-4, 5-2, 2-3, 3-4.\n\nNone of the connections in Graph 1 match the connections in Graph 2 completely.\n\nGiven these differing node compositions and connection patterns, the graphs do not match."
