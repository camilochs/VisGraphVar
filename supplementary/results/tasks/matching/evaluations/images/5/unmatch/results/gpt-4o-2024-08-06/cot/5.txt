   "analysis": "Step 1: Node count - Graph 1 has 5 nodes, Graph 2 also has 5 nodes. Both graphs have the same number of nodes.\nStep 2: Node labels - Graph 1 labels are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Graph 2 labels are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Node labels match in both graphs.\nStep 3: Edges - Graph 1 has edges (1-3), (3-2), (2-4). Graph 2 has edges (0-3), (3-4), (4-2). The edges do not match.\nStep 4: Weights - Graph 1 edges have no weights displayed. Graph 2 edges have weights, indicating they are different.\nConclusion: Due to different edge connections and presence of weights in Graph 2, the graphs do not match."
