   "analysis": "Step-by-step explanation of each element compared and why the final decision was reached.\n\n1. Node Count and Labels:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n   - Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n   - Both graphs have the same number of nodes.\n\n2. Node Connections:\n   - In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.\n   - In Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.\n   - The connections vary; Graph 1 connects 0 only to 3 and 4, whereas Graph 2 connects 0 to 2, 3, and 4.\n\n3. Additional Connections:\n   - Graph 1 has specific connections between nodes.\n     - Node 2 is connected to node 4.\n     - Node 3 is an isolated node connected to nodes 0 and 4.\n     - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.\n     - Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.\n   - Graph 2 connections between nodes.\n     - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.\n     - Node 4 is connected to node 1.\n     - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.\n     - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.\n\nConclusion:\nThe connections and specific relationships between nodes vary between the two graphs, especially node 0 having different connections in each graph. Therefore, the graphs do not match."
