   "analysis": "While both graphs contain the same number of nodes (5 nodes labeled 0-4) and the same number of edges, their connection patterns differ. In Graph 1, node 2 connects to nodes 1, 4, and 0, with node 3 connecting to nodes 0 and 1. In Graph 2, node 3 serves as a central connection point linking to nodes 0, 1, and 2, while node 4 connects to nodes 1 and 2. The overall structure and topology of these graphs are distinct despite having the same number of components."
