### Matching the Graphs

**Step 1: Counting Nodes and Edges**
*   Graph 1 has 4 nodes and 3 edges.
*   Graph 2 has 4 nodes and 3 edges.

**Step 2: Verifying Edge Connections**
*   In Graph 1, Node 3 connects to Node 2.
*   In Graph 1, Node 4 connects to Node 2.
*   In Graph 1, Node 0 connects to Node 1.
*   In Graph 2, Node 1 connects to Node 2.
*   In Graph 2, Node 3 connects to Node 0.
*   In Graph 2, Node 4 connects to Node 0.

**Step 3: Verifying Node Weights**
*   In Graph 1, Node 0 has a weight of 1.
*   In Graph 1, Node 1 has a weight of 2.
*   In Graph 1, Node 2 has a weight of 3.
*   In Graph 1, Node 3 has a weight of 4.
*   In Graph 2, Node 0 has a weight of 0.
*   In Graph 2, Node 1 has a weight of 1.
*   In Graph 2, Node 2 has a weight of 2.
*   In Graph 2, Node 3 has a weight of 3.
*   In Graph 2, Node 4 has a weight of 4.

**Step 4: Comparing Graphs**

*   Both graphs have the same number of nodes and edges.
*   The node and edge connections differ between the two graphs.

**Result:**

```json
{
    "match": "no",
    "analysis": "Despite having the same number of nodes and edges, Graph 1 and Graph 2 have differing node connections and node weights, making them non-matching." 
}
