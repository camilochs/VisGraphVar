Graph 1 (left diagram) has the following connections:\n   - Nodes 1 and 3.\n   - Nodes 3 and 2.\n   - Nodes 2 and 3.\n   - Nodes 3 and 4.\n4. Graph 2 (right diagram) has the following connections:\n   - Nodes 2 and 4.\n   - Nodes 4 and 1.\n   - Nodes 3 and 4.\n   - Nodes 3 and 2.\n5. The connections between nodes 2 and 4, 3 and 4, and 3 and 2 do match in both graphs, but the connection between nodes 1 and 3 in Graph 1 does not exist in Graph 2.\nConclusion: Each graph has a different set of connections overall, even though the nodes and some connections match.\nThus, the graphs do not match."
