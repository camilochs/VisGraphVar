Node Labels:\n   - Both graphs have the same labels (0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\n3. Edges:\n   - Graph 1 edges: (0-3, 0-1, 0-2, 1-2, 2-4).\n   - Graph 2 edges: (0-3, 0-1, 0-2, 1-2, 2-4).\n\n4. Edge Weights:\n   - There are no weights indicated on either graph.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - All nodes and edges correspond directly between the graphs with no discrepancies.\n\nTherefore, the graphs match."
