**Comparison of Graphs**

### Step 1: Node Count and Labels

* Both graphs have 5 nodes.
* Node labels in Graph 1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
* Node labels in Graph 2: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

### Step 2: Connection Analysis

* Edges in Graph 1: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4).
* Edges in Graph 2: (0, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (3, 0).

### Step 3: Determining the Match

* No identical edges found between the two graphs.

*Answer*: 
```json
{
  "match": "no",
  "analysis": "The graphs do not match because their edges differ. Graph 1 has edges (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), and (3, 4), while Graph 2 has edges (0, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), and (3, 0)."
}
