   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "Upon examining the two graphs, it is clear that they do not match. Graph 1 has nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9, arranged in a rectangular structure with mixed connections from top to bottom. Graph 2 has nodes labeled 1, 3, 5, 9, and an additional node 7 arranged in a non-rectangular, triangular structure with connections that are symmetric but do not correspond in configuration and node connections to Graph 1. Therefore, the structures, node labels, and connections do not align between the two graphs."
