   "analysis": "1. Node Count Analysis:\n   - Both graphs have 6 nodes labeled 0-4\n   - Node counts match\n\n2. Node Label Analysis:\n   - Graph 1: Contains nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4\n   - Graph 2: Contains nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4\n   - Node labels match\n\n3. Edge Analysis:\n   - Graph 1:\n     * Node 3 connects to 4 and 0\n     * Node 4 connects to 2 and 1\n     * Node 0 connects to 1\n     * Total of 7 edges\n   - Graph 2:\n     * Node 2 connects to 1 and 3\n     * Node 1 connects to 4\n     * Node 3 connects to 0\n     * Node 0 connects to 4\n     * Total of 6 edges\n\n4. Overall Structure:\n   - While the nodes are the same, the connection patterns are different\n   - Graph 1 forms a different geometric shape than Graph 2\n   - The number of edges differs between the graphs\n\nConclusion: The graphs do not match due to different edge connections and overall structure, despite having the same node labels."
