Node labels and positions: Both graphs have the same labels and visual layout, but:\n   - Node 0 in Graph 1 is connected to 2 and 3, whereas in Graph 2 it connects to 4 and 2 but in different positioning.\n   - Node 1 is connected in different ways; in Graph 1 it's part of a pagoda shape connected to 2 and 3, whereas in Graph 2 it's connected to form a parallelogram shape connected to 4.\n   - Node 2 connects in a different manner as well.\n   - Node 3 has different connections with only Graph 1 showing proper linkage.\n   - Nodes 4 in both graphs are topologically near each other but differ drastically in edges to nodes.\n\nThus, various connections in each graph along with structural differences in positioning indicate the graphs do not match."
