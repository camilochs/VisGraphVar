Edge Analysis:\n- Graph 1 has 3 edges forming a linear path (1-3-2-4)\n- Graph 2 has 3 edges forming a linear path (0-3-4-2) with an isolated node (1)\n\n3. Structure Analysis:\n- Graph 1 is a single connected component\n- Graph 2 has two components (main path and isolated node)\n\n4. Final Decision:\nGraphs do not match because:\n- Different number of total nodes (4 vs 5)\n- Different node labels and connectivity\n- Different overall structure (one connected vs two components)\n- Different edge patterns and node relationships"
