   "analysis": "While both graphs contain 6 nodes labeled 0-4, their structures are different. Graph 1 (blue) has a linear branch from node 4 to 2 and connections forming a triangle between nodes 0, 3, and 4, with node 1 connected to 3. Graph 2 (green) has a more star-like structure with node 1 as a central point connecting to nodes 0 and 4, and additional connections forming a triangle between nodes 0, 3, and 4, with node 2 connected to 4. The overall topology and connection patterns are distinct between the two graphs."
