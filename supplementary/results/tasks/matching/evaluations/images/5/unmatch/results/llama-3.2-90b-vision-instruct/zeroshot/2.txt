**Step-by-Step Answer**

To assess whether two specific graph images match, a visual analysis of the provided images is needed to verify if the structure, node connections, and attributes like weights (if present) align between them.

*   Upon receiving the images, identify the number of vertices (nodes) and edges between them in each graph.
*   Compare these numbers between the two graphs. If they don't align, a match can be ruled out. If they do, proceed further.

Given the absence of actual graph images:

*   Assume that the provided "graph images" have nodes denoted by numbers 0 through 4 for both graphs, implying structural similarity, thus, further examination of the edge counts and patterns is required for an accurate assessment.
*   Hypothetically speaking, if Graph 1 has five edges and Graph 2 has four, matching is not possible.

A graph match in this absence of provided images but with hypothetical numbers for nodes can be determined as follows in the provided JSON format: 

```json
{
    "match": "no",
    "analysis": "Difference in edge counts or patterns indicates the graphs do not match."
}
```
Note that a specific answer based on actual graph visuals is unavailable and relies on the hypothetical values for nodes and edges provided, suggesting an unsuccessful match.
