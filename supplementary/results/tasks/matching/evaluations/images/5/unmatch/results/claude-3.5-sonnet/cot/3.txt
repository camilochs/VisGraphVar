    "analysis": "1. Node Count Check:\n- Both graphs have 5 nodes labeled 0,1,2,3,4\n- Node count matches\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\nGraph 1:\n- Edge (0,3)\n- Edge (0,4)\n- Edge (1,3)\n- Edge (2,4)\n- Edge (3,4)\n\nGraph 2:\n- Edge (0,1)\n- Edge (0,3)\n- Edge (0,4)\n- Edge (2,4)\n\n3. Structure Comparison:\n- Different number of edges (Graph 1 has 5 edges, Graph 2 has 4 edges)\n- Different connectivity patterns\n- Graph 1 has node 3 connected to nodes 0,1,4\n- Graph 2 has node 0 as central node connected to 1,3,4\n\nConclusion: While the graphs have the same nodes, they have different edge connections and overall structure, therefore they do not match."
