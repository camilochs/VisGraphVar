**Determining Graph Matching: An Examination of Two Graph Images**

Upon analyzing the provided graph images, it is evident that both graphs exhibit identical structures and node connections. However, a crucial difference lies in their weights, which are present in one graph but absent in the other. This distinction is a key factor in determining whether the two graphs match.

**Matching Criteria**

To declare the graphs as matching, three essential criteria must be met:

*   **Structural Identity**: Both graphs must have the same nodes and connections between them.
*   **Node Connection Identity**: The connections between nodes must be identical in both graphs.
*   **Weighted Equality**: If weights are present, they must be identical in both graphs.

**Analysis and Conclusion**

Although the graphs share identical structures and node connections, the presence of weights in one graph and their absence in another constitutes a significant difference. Therefore, based on the weighted equality criterion, the graphs do not match.
