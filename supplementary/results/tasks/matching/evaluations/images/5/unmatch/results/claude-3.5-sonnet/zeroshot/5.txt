   "analysis": "The graphs have different structures. Graph 1 is a linear path with 4 nodes (numbered 4-2-3-1) connected in sequence. Graph 2 is also a linear path with 4 nodes (numbered 0-3-4-2) plus an isolated node (numbered 1). Additionally, Graph 1 uses gray edges while Graph 2 uses orange/yellow edges. The node numbering sequences are different, and Graph 2 has one extra disconnected node that Graph 1 doesn't have."
