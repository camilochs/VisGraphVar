   "analysis": "The graphs appear to have the same set of vertices, but the connections are different. In Graph 1, the vertices 0, 1, 2, and 4 form a triangle with vertex 4 linked to vertex 0. Vertex 1 is linked to vertex 3. In Graph 2, vertices 0, 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle, with vertex 4 linked to vertex 2. Therefore, the structural differences indicate that the graphs do not match."
