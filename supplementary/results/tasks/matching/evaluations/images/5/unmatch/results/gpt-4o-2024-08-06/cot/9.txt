   "analysis": "Step 1: Count nodes in both graphs. Graph 1 has 5 nodes labeled 0-4. Graph 2 also has 5 nodes labeled 0-4. Step 2: Compare connections. Graph 1 has edges: 0-1, 0-3, 0-4, 1-2, 1-4, 2-4. Graph 2 has edges: 0-1, 0-3, 0-4, 1-2, 1-4, 2-4. Step 3: Check for weighted edges. Both graphs have unweighted edges. Conclusion: Both graphs have identical node counts, labels, and connections, so they match."
