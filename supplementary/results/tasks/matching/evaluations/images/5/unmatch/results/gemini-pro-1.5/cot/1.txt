If we reposition node 3 in Graph 2 to the same relative position as node 2 in Graph 1 (and similarly for all other nodes), and redraw the edges using the corresponding connections shown above shows that the two graphs are isomorphic. They present the same connections using different layouts.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since the node counts, labels, and underlying connection structure match, the graphs are considered equivalent."
