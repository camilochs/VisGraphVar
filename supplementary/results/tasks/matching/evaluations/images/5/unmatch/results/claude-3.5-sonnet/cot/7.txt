   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "1. Node Count: Both graphs have 5 nodes labeled 0-4, so this matches.\n\n2. Edge Analysis:\nGraph 1:\n- Node 0 connects to nodes 1, 2, and 4\n- Node 1 connects to node 3\n- Forms a Y-shape with an extended branch\n\nGraph 2:\n- Node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 3\n- Node 1 connects to node 2\n- Node 2 connects to node 4\n- Forms a different structure with a more linear arrangement\n\n3. Structure Comparison:\n- The overall topology is different\n- Graph 1 has a Y-shape with an extension\n- Graph 2 has a more branching pattern\n\n4. Final Decision: The graphs do not match because although they have the same number of nodes, the connections between nodes are arranged differently, creating distinct topological structures."
