**Analysis of Graph Matching**

To determine if the two graphs match, we need to compare their components, including node counts and labels, and edges with their respective weights.

**Step 1: Node Count and Label Comparison**

Graph 1 has 4 nodes labeled as 0, 1, 2, and 3. Similarly, Graph 2 also has 4 nodes labeled as 0, 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, both graphs have the same number of nodes with identical labels.

**Step 2: Edge Comparison**

Now, let's compare the edges in both graphs:

*   In Graph 1, there is an edge between nodes 0 and 1 without any weight.
*   In Graph 2, there is also an edge between nodes 0 and 1 without any weight.
*   In Graph 1, there is an edge between nodes 0 and 3 without any weight.
*   In Graph 2, there is an edge between nodes 0 and 3 without any weight.
*   In Graph 1, there is an edge between nodes 1 and 2 without any weight.
*   In Graph 2, there is an edge between nodes 1 and 3 without any weight.
*   In Graph 1, there is an edge between nodes 2 and 4 without any weight.
*   In Graph 2, there is an edge between nodes 2 and 4 without any weight.

It's clear that while both graphs have edges connecting nodes 1 and 2, the directions differ. Graph 1 connects node 2 to node 3, while Graph 2 connects node 1 to node 3.

**Conclusion**

Based on the comparison of nodes and edges, it's evident that the two graphs do not match due to differences in the directions of some edges.
