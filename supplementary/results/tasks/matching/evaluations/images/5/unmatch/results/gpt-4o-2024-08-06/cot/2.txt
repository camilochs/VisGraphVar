Connections/Edges: \n   - Graph 1 has edges: (2-3), (2-0), (0-4) with no visible weights.\n   - Graph 2 has edges: (0-1), (1-3), (3-4) with no visible weights.\n4. Differences in Connections: The edges in Graph 1 do not match the edges in Graph 2. Does not match.\n5. Weights: No weights in either graph to compare.\nFinal Decision: Since the edges do not align between the two graphs, they do not match."
