   "analysis": "1. Node Count Comparison:\n- Graph 1 has 5 nodes (0,1,2,3,4)\n- Graph 2 has 5 nodes (0,1,2,3,4)\n\n2. Structure Comparison:\n- Graph 1 is a linear path with nodes connected in sequence: 2-3-4-0\n- Graph 2 is a linear path with nodes connected in sequence: 3-4-0-1\n\n3. Key Differences:\n- Graph 1's path starts with node 2 and ends at node 0\n- Graph 2's path starts with node 3 and ends at node 1\n- Graph 1 uses gray edges\n- Graph 2 uses orange edges\n- The node arrangements are completely different\n\n4. Conclusion: While both graphs have the same number of nodes, they differ in their connectivity patterns, edge colors, and overall structure, therefore they do not match."
