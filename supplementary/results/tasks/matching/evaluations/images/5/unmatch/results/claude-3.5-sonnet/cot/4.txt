   "analysis": "1. Node Count Check:\n   - Both graphs have 6 nodes each\n   - Both graphs have nodes labeled 0-4\n\n2. Node Position Analysis:\n   - Graph 1 has nodes arranged in a vertical chain on the left side (4-3-2) with isolated nodes 1 and 0\n   - Graph 2 has nodes arranged differently with a chain (3-4-0) and isolated nodes 1 and 2\n\n3. Edge Analysis:\n   - Graph 1 has edges connecting: 4-3-2 in a vertical chain\n   - Graph 2 has edges connecting: 3-4-0 in a different configuration\n   - The number and structure of connections differ between graphs\n\n4. Overall Structure:\n   - While both graphs contain the same number of nodes with the same labels, their connectivity patterns are completely different\n   - Graph 1 forms a vertical chain with two isolated nodes\n   - Graph 2 forms a different chain structure with two different isolated nodes\n\nConclusion: The graphs do not match due to different edge connections and overall structure."
