   "analysis": "Step 1: Count the nodes in each graph. Graph 1 has 5 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Graph 2 also has 5 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The node counts match.\n\nStep 2: Compare node labels. Both graphs have nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The labels match.\n\nStep 3: Compare edges. Graph 1 has edges (2-3) and (3-4). Graph 2 has edges (0-4) and (3-4). The edges do not match.\n\nStep 4: Check for edge weights (if any). Graph 1 does not show weighted edges, nor does Graph 2. Match is not dependent on weights.\n\nConclusion: Although the node counts and labels match, the edges between nodes do not, leading to the conclusion that the graphs do not match."
