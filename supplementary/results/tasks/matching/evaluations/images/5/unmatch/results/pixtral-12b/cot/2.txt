Step 1: Node Count and Labels
- Graph 1 has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Graph 2 has 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Step 2: Node Connections
- Graph 1:
  - Node 0 is connected to node 1.
  - Node 1 is connected to node 2.
  - Node 2 is connected to node 3.
  - Node 3 is connected to node 4.

- Graph 2:
  - Node 0 is connected to node 1.
  - Node 1 is connected to node 3.
  - Node 3 is connected to node 2.
  - Node 2 is connected to node 0.

Step 3: Edge Comparisons
- Graph 1 has a sequential connection forming a linear structure.
- Graph 2 has a cyclic structure forming a triangle.

Conclusion:
- The node labels are the same in both graphs.
- The connections (structure and sequence of edges) differ significantly between the two graphs.

Thus, the final conclusion is that the graphs do not match.
