{
   "match": "no",
   "analysis": "The graphs do not match because the edges and nodes do not align. Graph 1 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and Graph 2 has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. However, the connections between these nodes are different. For example, in Graph 1, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4, while in Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4. The specific edges and their connections do not align between the two graphs."
