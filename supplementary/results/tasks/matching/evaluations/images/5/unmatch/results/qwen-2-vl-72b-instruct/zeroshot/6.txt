   "analysis": "The two graphs have different structures. In Graph 1, node 0 is connected to node 4, which is in turn connected to node 3, and node 2 is a separate node. In Graph 2, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 3 are connected in a different sequence. The connections and structures between the nodes are not identical, hence the graphs do not match."
