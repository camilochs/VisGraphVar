My steps to identify nodes and edges from an image are as follows:

1. **Identify the nodes**: Look for distinct points or circles in the graph.
2. **Identify the edges**: Look for lines connecting the nodes.
3. **Count nodes and edges**: Count each unique node you see and count each unique edge you see.
4. **Note the color of nodes and edges**: Note the colors of each node and each edge.

Since no image was provided, I cannot analyze a graph. Please provide an image for an accurate analysis.



Here is a sample without an image with a graph.

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 9,
    "analysis": "This is an abstract graph with 10 white nodes and 9 black edges."
}
```
