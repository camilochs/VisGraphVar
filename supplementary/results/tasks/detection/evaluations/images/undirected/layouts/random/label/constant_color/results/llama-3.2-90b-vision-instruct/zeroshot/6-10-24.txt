**Step 1: Identify the number of nodes**

Nodes are identified separately. In this graph, the nine nodes are labeled 0-9.

**Step 2: Identify the number of edges**

Edges are identified as lines that connect nodes. The greater the number of edges, the greater the points (connections) each node intersects.

**Step 3: Analyze node and edge colors**

In this graph, nodes are white circles and edges are black lines.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "A 9-node undirected graph of connected white circles and black lines, denoting the intersection between pairs of nodes".
}
