**Analysis of the Graph**

### Total Nodes

To determine the total number of nodes, we count each circle in the graph. The nodes are represented by circles with different colors: green, blue, red, purple, and pink. There are 10 such circles.

*   Total nodes: 10

### Total Edges

Each line connecting two nodes represents an edge. We count the individual lines between the nodes. There are 20 such lines.

*   Total edges: 20

### Analysis

The graph features 10 nodes and 20 edges. The nodes are colored in green, blue, red, purple, and pink. The edges are represented by black lines connecting the nodes.
