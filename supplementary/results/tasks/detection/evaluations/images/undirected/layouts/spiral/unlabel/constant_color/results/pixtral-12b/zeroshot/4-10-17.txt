Here is the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 11,
   "total_edges": 21,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 11 nodes and 21 edges. The nodes and edges are represented in black. The connections between nodes appear to be relatively complex, with each node linked to multiple others in a non-acyclic fashion."
}
