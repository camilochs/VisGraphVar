The image provided features a network graph with clear node connections or edges, each visually distinct. Below are the details of the observed graph:

**Nodes Counting**

Each node can be uniquely identified by its numbers. Numbering each node gives us a total count:

{1=green, 2=olive green, 3=blue, 4=yellow, 5=green, 6=navy blue, 7=green, 8=brown, 9=brown, 0=green, and pink=1}

Total nodes in the graph: 10

**Edges Counting**

Identifying edges may pose a difficulty, eagerly accustomed to emphasizing nodes or prominence on points of interest. Nevertheless, an estimation using observed patterns on the graph infers there are 20 edges, see subsequent tabular description example follows:
