  "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes, colored black, maroon, gold, grey-purple, dark purple, purple, light purple, light green, yellow-green, and light red. There are 20 edges, all of which are black. Nodes are arranged in a roughly circular pattern with edges connecting every node to approximately half of the others. Node 8 is centrally located, black, larger than others, and represents either node addition or removal in other snapshots of animations created that start at 3 or fewer nodes and are built by either adding or deleting 1 node & 4 edges."
