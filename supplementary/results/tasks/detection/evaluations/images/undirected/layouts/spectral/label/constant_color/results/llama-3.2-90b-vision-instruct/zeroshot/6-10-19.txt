The graph has 10 nodes, labeled from 0 to 9. Let's count the edges: 

There are 9 edges between the following nodes:

*   0 and 1
*   0 and 9
*   1 and 3
*   1 and 5
*   2 and 6
*   3 and 7
*   4 and 5
*   5 and 8
*   8 and 6

Therefore, the answer in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 9,
    "analysis": "The graph is a simple line graph with 10 nodes and 9 edges. The color used for most of the nodes is a dark bold color, whereas the edges are drawn in a light plain black color."
}
```
