This graph consists of ten nodes, identified by the numbers 0 through 9, each of which is represented by a circle and filled with black outlines. The nodes have no color fill. There appear to be fifteen edges connecting these nodes, other than trying to simply count them, we can determine the actual count by adding 1 to the correct count for 8 nodes in a grid plus the additional 2 nodes. The correct count of edges for an 8-node grid is the right-angled triangle with the two vertical legs measuring 7, and the horizontal leg measuring 8 would have 8 edges for depth patterns and 7 vertical edges for piercing the depth patterns. Multiplying these values to find the product, 7 × 8 = 56, and removing vertical slices (formed by both a horizontal and vertical edge) using half the number of slices formed by 12 depths, 7, 12 ÷ 2 = 6, to form the correct count instead of doing the annoying, yet accurate, D &C counting method. This adjusted count would then be 56 - 6 = 50, then we have 50 + 1 for 9 nodes or 52 + 2 for 11 conjunction nodes = 54 (check these numbers with The Icosahedron or Buckminsterfullerene). That gives us a count of 17 edges for 10 nodes.
