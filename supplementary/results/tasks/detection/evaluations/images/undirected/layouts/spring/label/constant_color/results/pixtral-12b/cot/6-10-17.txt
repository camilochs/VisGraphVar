Sure, let's analyze the graph step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Nodes:**
   - There are 10 distinct nodes, each represented by a circle with a number inside.
   - The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9.

2. **Identify the Edges:**
   - There are 14 distinct edges, each represented by a line connecting two nodes.
   - All edges are the same color (black).

3. **Summarize The Analysis:**
   - The total number of nodes is 10.
   - The total number of edges is 14.
   - The graph has an intricate structure with some nodes connecting to more than two other nodes. The layout appears to be somewhat extended and complex.

### JSON Summary:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes, each uniquely numbered from 0 to 9, forming a complex network. There are 14 edges, each of the same black color, indicating connections between the nodes. The graph includes multiple connections, highlighting a hub-and-spoke structure with certain nodes central to the network."
