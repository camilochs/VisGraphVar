**Image Not Provided**

Since there is no image to analyze, I will provide a template of what the analysis is supposed to look like once the image is received:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 0,
   "total_edges": 0,
   "analysis": "There was no image provided to analyze."
}
```

Once I receive an image, I may then carry out the node and edge count as requested.
