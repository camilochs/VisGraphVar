### Original Answer (Below)
The "graph" does not exist in your prompt. 

However, the following is the general format in JSON of how you could report the number of nodes and edges:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 0,
    "total_edges": 0,
    "analysis": "There are no nodes and no edges in the graph."
}
â€‹
```

Please note that in order to complete the prompt, more information might be required because the prompt currently lacks a "graph." Please provide an example graph so that I can better assist you with your inquiry. 

We would welcome any additional questions or follow-up queries you would like clarification on.
