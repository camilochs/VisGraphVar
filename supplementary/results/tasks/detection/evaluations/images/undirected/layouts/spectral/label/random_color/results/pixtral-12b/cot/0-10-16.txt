Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - The nodes are represented by colored circles.
   - The distinct nodes and their colors are:
     - Node 1: Green
     - Node 2: Light Blue
     - Node 3: Pink
     - Node 4: Magenta
     - Node 5: Purple
     - Node 6: Dark Magenta
     - Node 7: Dark Pink
     - Node 8: Brown
     - Node 9: Light Purple

   Total number of nodes: 9

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.
   - The distinct edges are:
     - Connection between Node 1 and Node 5
     - Connection between Node 1 and Node 6
     - Connection between Node 2 and Node 8
     - Connection between Node 2 and Node 9
     - Connection between Node 3 and Node 6
     - Connection between Node 3 and Node 7
     - Connection between Node 4 and Node 7
     - Connection between Node 4 and Node 9
     - Connection between Node 6 and Node 7
     - Connection between Node 6 and Node 9
     - Connection between Node 8 and Node 9

   Total number of edges: 12

3. **Summarize your findings:**
   - Total number of nodes: 9
   - Total number of edges: 12
   - The graph is a connected graph with nodes of different colors. The nodes are connected by black edges, and there are no edges of different colors.

4. **Format your answer:**
   Here is the analysis in the required JSON format:

   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 9,
      "total_edges": 12,
      "analysis": "The graph is a connected graph with 9 nodes of different colors and 12 black edges."
   }
   ```
