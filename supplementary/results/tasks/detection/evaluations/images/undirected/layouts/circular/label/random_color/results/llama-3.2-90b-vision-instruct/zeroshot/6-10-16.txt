**Step 1: Analyze the image to identify nodes and edges**

Upon examining the image, we can see that there are colored circles representing nodes and lines connecting them represent edges.

**Step 2: Count the number of nodes**

There are 9 nodes in the graph. 

**Step 3: Count the number of edges**

There are 16 edges in the graph.

**Step 4: Observe the color of nodes and edges**

The nodes are colored in red, purple, blue, and green. The edges are black. 

**Step 5: Format the answer in JSON**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "This is an undirected graph with black colored edges and red, purple, blue, and green colored nodes."
}
```
