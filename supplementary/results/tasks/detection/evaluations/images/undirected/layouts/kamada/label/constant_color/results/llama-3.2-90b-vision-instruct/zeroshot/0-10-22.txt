**Step 1: Count the number of nodes**

The nodes are represented by small circles or dots on the graph. Each node has a unique number assigned to it.

*   **Node 0**: Located at the bottom right corner
*   **Node 1**: Directly above Node 0
*   **Node 2**: At the top left corner
*   **Node 3**: Directly to the right of Node 2
*   **Node 4**: Above Node 3
*   **Node 5**: At the bottom left corner
*   **Node 6**: To the right of Node 5 and directly below Node 2
*   **Node 7**: To the left of Node 6
*   **Node 8**: Directly below Node 6 and above Node 1
*   **Node 9**: At the bottom center of the graph

There are **10** nodes in total.

**Step 2: Count the number of edges**

Edges are represented by lines connecting two nodes.

*   An edge connects Node 0 and Node 1.
*   An edge connects Node 0 and Node 9.
*   An edge connects Node 1 and Node 8.
*   An edge connects Node 1 and Node 4.
*   An edge connects Node 3 and Node 6.
*   An edge connects Node 3 and Node 8.
*   An edge connects Node 4 and Node 9.
*   An edge connects Node 2 and Node 6.
*   An edge connects Node 2 and Node 7.
*   An edge connects Node 6 and Node 8.
*   An edge connects Node 5 and Node 7.
*   An edge connects Node 6 and Node 7.
*   An edge connects Node 5 and Node 8.
*   An edge connects Node 8 and Node 9.

There are **14** edges in total.

**Step 3: Analyze the graph**

The graph consists of 10 nodes and 14 edges. All the edges are black, and all the nodes are white.

**Answer**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. All the edges are black, and all the nodes are white."
}
