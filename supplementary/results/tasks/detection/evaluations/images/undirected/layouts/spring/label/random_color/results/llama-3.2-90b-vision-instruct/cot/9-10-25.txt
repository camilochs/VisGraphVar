**Finding the Number of Nodes and Edges in a Graph**

**Step 1: Identify the Nodes**

*   The graph contains 10 nodes.
*   The nodes are colored differently, but the specific colors are not specified. However, they can be referred to by their labels (1-10) and relative positions:

    *   Top node (5)
    *   Upper-right node (6)
    *   Lower-right node (1)
    *   Lower-left node (2)
    *   Corner node (9) connected to the lower-left node (2)
    *   Top-middle node (4) connected to the lower-left node (2)
    *   Top-left node (3) connected to the upper-left node (9)
    *   Top-right node (7) connected to the upper-right node (6)
    *   Lower-left node (8) connected to the lower-right node (1)
    *   Middle node (0) connected to all the other nodes in the graph

**Step 2: Identify the Edges**

*   The graph contains 14 edges.
*   Each edge has the same line width. However, as in the nodes,  the line color is not indicated.

**Step 3: Summarize Findings**

*   Total number of nodes in the graph: 10
*   Total number of edges in the graph: 14

**Analysis:**

*   Graph appearance: 10 nodes are connected by 14 edges.

**Step 4: Format Your Answer**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 14,
    "analysis": "The graph is undirected. All nodes are colored differently. The graph has a mix of cycles. It is difficult to visualize the colors of the nodes and edges because the question was not yet given."
}
