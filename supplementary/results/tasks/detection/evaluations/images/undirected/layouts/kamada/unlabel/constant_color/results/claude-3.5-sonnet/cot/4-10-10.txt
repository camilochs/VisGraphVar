Following the steps provided, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 9,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 white circular nodes connected by 9 black straight edges. The structure resembles a constellation or network diagram, with some nodes having multiple connections and others having only one connection."
}
```

This analysis is based on careful counting of the distinct circular nodes and the lines connecting them in the provided black and white image. The graph has an interesting shape that doesn't follow a regular pattern, which gives it a somewhat organic or celestial appearance.
