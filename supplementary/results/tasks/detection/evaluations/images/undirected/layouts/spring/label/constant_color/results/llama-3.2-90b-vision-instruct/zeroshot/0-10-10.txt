**Step 1: Identify the nodes and edges in the graph.**

The graph has 9 nodes labeled from 0 to 8. Each node is connected to other nodes by edges.

**Step 2: Count the number of nodes and edges in the graph.**

There are 9 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) and 9 edges connecting these nodes.

**Step 3: Provide a brief description of the graph.**

The graph is a simple undirected graph with 9 nodes and 9 edges. All edges are black, and all nodes are white.

**Step 4: Format the answer in JSON format.**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 9,
   "analysis": "A simple undirected graph with 9 nodes and 9 edges. All edges are black, and all nodes are white."
}
