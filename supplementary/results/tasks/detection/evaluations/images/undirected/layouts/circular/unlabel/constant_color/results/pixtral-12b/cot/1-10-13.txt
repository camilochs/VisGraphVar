Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step:

1. **Identify the nodes**:
   - The graph contains distinct points represented by small circles.
   - By counting each unique node, we find there are a total of 8 nodes in the graph.
   - All nodes are white (no color differentiation).

2. **Identify the edges**:
   - The graph contains lines connecting the nodes.
   - By counting each unique edge, we find there are a total of 14 edges in the graph.
   - All edges are black (no color differentiation).

3. **Summarize findings**:
   - The graph is a fully connected graph with 8 nodes and 14 edges.
   - Nodes are uniformly white.
   - Edges are uniformly black.

4. **JSON Format**:
   - Here is the graph's analysis in JSON format:

   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 8,
      "total_edges": 14,
      "analysis": "The graph is a fully connected graph with 8 white nodes and 14 black edges."
   }
   ```

This detailed analysis gives a clear understanding of the configuration of the graph.
