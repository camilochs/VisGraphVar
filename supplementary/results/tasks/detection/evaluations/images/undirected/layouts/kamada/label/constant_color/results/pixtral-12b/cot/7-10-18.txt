Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step:

1. **Identify the Nodes:**
   - The graph shows distinct nodes represented by numbered circles (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
   - There are a total of 10 unique nodes.

2. **Identify the Edges:**
   - The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.
   - Counting the edges from the image, there are 19 edges.

3. **Summarize Your Findings:**
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 19
   - The nodes are represented by numbered circles.
   - The edges are shown as black lines.

4. **Format the Answer:**
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 19,
   "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes represented by numbered circles and 19 edges represented by black lines."
}
```

This JSON format summarizes the information about the number of nodes and edges and provides a brief description of the graph's appearance.
