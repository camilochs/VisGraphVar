To determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Identify the Nodes

*   The graph has circles or points that represent nodes.
*   Counting each unique node yields a total of 10 nodes.
*   All nodes are white.

### Step 2: Identify the Edges

*   Lines connecting the nodes constitute the edges.
*   Counting each unique edge gives us a total of 17 edges.
*   All edges are black.

### Step 3: Summarize Findings

*   Total nodes: 10
*   Total edges: 17
*   The graph appears as a black network of lines connecting white circles against a white background.

### Final Answer

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The graph is a black network of lines connecting white circles against a white background."
}
