**Analysis of the Graph**

Here is a JSON format representation of the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 11,
  "analysis": "This is a directed graph with 9 nodes and 11 edges. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9. Node 1 is connected only to node 8. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6. Node 3 is connected to node 6. Node 4 is connected to node 7. Node 5 is connected to node 0. Node 6 is connected to node 3. Node 7 is connected to node 4. Node 8 is connected only to node 1. Node 9 is connected only to node 0. All the nodes and edges are black in color."
