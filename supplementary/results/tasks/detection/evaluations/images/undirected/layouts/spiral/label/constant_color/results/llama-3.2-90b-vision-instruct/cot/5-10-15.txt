Based on the analysis of the graph, I have identified the following elements:

**Nodes:**

*   The graph contains 10 distinct nodes, numbered from 0 to 9.
*   All nodes are represented by white circles with black outlines.

**Edges:**

*   The graph consists of 12 edges, connecting various nodes.
*   All edges are represented by solid black lines.

**Summary:**

I have found a total of 10 nodes and 12 edges in the given graph.


The final answer is:

\```python
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 12,
    "analysis": "a graph with 10 white nodes numbered from 0 to 9, connected by 12 solid black edges"
}
\```
