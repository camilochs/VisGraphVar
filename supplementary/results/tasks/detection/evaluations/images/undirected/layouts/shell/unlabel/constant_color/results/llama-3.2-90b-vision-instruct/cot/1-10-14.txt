Based on the image, I identify the following by performing the steps below:

1.  The nodes of this graph are ten circular openings.
2.  The edges of this graph are the lines connecting the nodes. There appear to be sixteen edges total.

In summary, there are ten circular nodes, joining 16 lines.

A simple way of representing that information will be as follows:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "A simple uncolored graph with ten circular nodes connecting 16 lines".
}
```
