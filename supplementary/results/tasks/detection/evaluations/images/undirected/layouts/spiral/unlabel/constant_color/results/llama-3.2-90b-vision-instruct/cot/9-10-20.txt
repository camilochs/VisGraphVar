**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   The graph has 10 distinct points or circles, each representing a node.
*   All nodes are white.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   There are 17 lines connecting the nodes, each representing an edge.
*   All edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

*   Total number of nodes: 10
*   Total number of edges: 17
*   The graph appears as a simple, undirected graph with white nodes and black edges.

**Step 4: Format your answer**

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 17,
  "analysis": "The graph is a simple, undirected graph with white nodes and black edges."
}
```

Answer:
