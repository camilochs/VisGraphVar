The nodes have various colors, including green, lime green, steel blue, crimson, tomato, dark red, medium orchid, lime green, lightsteelblue, and dark red. There are 14 edges connecting these nodes, all of which appear to be black. The graph does not appear to be fully connected (not all nodes directly connected to each other) and forms a somewhat irregular shape."
