Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image:

1. Identifying the nodes:
   - There are 8 distinct points or circles in the graph.
   - All nodes are represented by white circles with black outlines.

2. Identifying the edges:
   - There are 18 lines connecting the nodes.
   - All edges are represented by black lines.

3. Summarizing the findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 8
   - Total number of edges: 18
   - The graph appears to be a three-dimensional structure, resembling a distorted cube or prism.

4. Formatting the answer in JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 18,
   "analysis": "The graph shows a three-dimensional structure with 8 white nodes connected by 18 black edges, resembling a distorted cube or prism."
}
