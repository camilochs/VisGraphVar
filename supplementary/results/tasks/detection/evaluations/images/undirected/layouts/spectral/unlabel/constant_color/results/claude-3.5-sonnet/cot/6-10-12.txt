Following the steps provided, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 9,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of white circular nodes connected by black lines forming edges. It has a T-shaped structure with one main branch and two shorter branches. The nodes are of equal size and are evenly spaced along the edges."
}
```

This analysis is based on careful counting of the distinct circular nodes and the lines connecting them in the image. The graph has a simple, clean appearance with a clear structure and no additional decorative elements or colors beyond the basic black and white scheme.
