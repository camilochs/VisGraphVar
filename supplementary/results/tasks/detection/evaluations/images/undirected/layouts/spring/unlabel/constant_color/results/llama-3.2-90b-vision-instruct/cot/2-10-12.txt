**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   Look for distinct points or circles in the graph. 
*   Count each unique node you see. There are 9 nodes in the image.
*   Note the color of the nodes. In this image, the nodes are white.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   Look for lines connecting the nodes.  There are lines connecting all of the nodes in the image.
*   Count each unique edge you see. There are 7 edges in this image.
*   Note the color of the edges. The edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

*   Report the total number of nodes. There are 9 nodes.
*   Report the total number of edges. There are 7 edges.
*   Briefly describe the graph's appearance: "White circles with black lines"

**Step 4: Format your answer**

Here is your answer formatted in JSON:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 7,
  "analysis": "White circles with black lines"
}
```
