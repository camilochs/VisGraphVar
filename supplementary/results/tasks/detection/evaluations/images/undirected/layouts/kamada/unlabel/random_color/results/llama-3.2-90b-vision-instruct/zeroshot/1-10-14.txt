**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image shows a graph consisting of 9 nodes and multiple connecting edges. As the image is in a .png format, it is necessary to count the nodes and edges manually.

**Step 2: Count the nodes**

The nodes of this graph are recognizable as vertices with specific vertices from different edge connections. Based on the image, the nodes have a uniform circular ridge and are marked using different colors (Orange, pink, dark red, green, and other vibrant colors). It is simple to identify nodes visually by counting the small circular objects scattered across the page.

After manually counting, it was possible to see nine nodes in total.

**Step 3: Count the edges**

Edges connect the nodes of this graph by forming a straight or slightly curved line between them. Based on visual approximation, the length of the edges can give you a reasonable estimate of the number edges there are, considering they usually appear in pairs and are evenly distributed.

**Step 4: Count the edges**

Once identified, manually counting the edges will give you an accurate answer that can be relayed in your solution. It is possible to count 13 edges, seen as lines in this graph

**Step 5: Provide final answer in JSON format**

Here is the results from the previous steps.

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The image is a graph with vertices representing different elements. Each node appears as a dot or circle and is connected by lines to the closest neighbor. Two nodes are always connected to two edges, creating a loop that doesn't appear too evenly distributed because of the lack of nodes."
}
