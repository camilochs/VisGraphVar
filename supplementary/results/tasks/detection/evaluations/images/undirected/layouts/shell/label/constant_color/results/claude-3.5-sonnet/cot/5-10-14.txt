Following the steps provided, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 15,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes, numbered from 0 to 9. These nodes are connected by 15 black edges forming a complex network. The graph appears to be undirected, with no apparent hierarchy or central node. The edges create various interconnections between the nodes, resulting in a somewhat symmetrical structure."
