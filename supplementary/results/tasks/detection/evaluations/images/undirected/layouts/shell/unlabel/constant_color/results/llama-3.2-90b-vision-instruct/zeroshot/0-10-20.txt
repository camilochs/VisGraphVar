**Analysis of the Graph**

While displaying the graph in an image format limits exact analysis, I can estimate and give approximate answers. 

**Step 1: Analyzing the nodes.**

The visual provided displays a series of values in circular shapes, connected by lines divided into two groups of "edges", denoted by line colors. There appear to be nine circular nodes in total, with three in each sub-group of differently colored edges. 

**Nodes:**

*   There are a total of nine nodes, each marked by a white circular shape. The nodes are not differentiated by colors.

**Step 2: Counting the edges.**

To calculate the total amount of edges present in the graph, we will follow the colored edges between a random starting node. Nodes with the same color edges mean those edges are part of the same "group" or "sub-graph" and should only be counted once. 

Every edge within a group of nodes has the same distance from the starting node, ensuring they belong to the same group for the bet counting. Count along the rounded shape, including the initially chosen edge considered as part of the edge group. Then proceed down the straight-edged chain of nodes, remaining parallel with the horizontal edges, returning to the edge greater. 

The black connecting edge and the gray connecting edge in the 2D (flattened) image to the right should be considered as the same. These calculations do not allow for 3D edge perception to deter skew calculations. By following the edge coloring encoded into the graph through image representations and considering only horizontal and vertical edges as separate, the count should be calculated as follows:

*   Black edges - 10
*   Gray edges - 7

In total, there are seventeen lines, denoting the edges in the given graph. The line colors are black and gray, differentiated by edge separation across the nodes.



**Conclusion:**

Based on these estimates, the graph is estimated as follows:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "There are two distinct edge colors (gray and black). Each edge may have more than two 2D edge values, considering compound shapes". 
}
```
