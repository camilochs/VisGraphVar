**Step 1: Count the number of nodes in the image**

Based on the image shown above, we count a total of 10 distinct nodes, excluding the two (on the top and bottom left) as they appear like "firewalls" and will not be factored into the final total.

**Step 2: Count the number of edges in the image**

In the context of this graph, "edges" refer to the connections between various nodes. Using the preceding observation in our step 1 analysis, we observe a total of 10 directed and symmetrical edges.


**Final Step: Compile Counts into a JSON Matrix**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 10,
    "analysis": "In the graph, nodes are depicted as uncolored circles. Edges are represented as thin, black lines running from one node to the next."
}
```

*Answer*: 
```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 10,
    "analysis": "In the graph, nodes are depicted as uncolored circles. Edges are represented as thin, black lines running from one node to the next."
}
