The provided image displays a graph with 9 nodes and 15 edges. The nodes are colored in blue, green, yellow, purple, brown, peach, red, black, and lavender, and the edges vary in intensity. The graph has six distinct colors.

Numerically, the number of nodes and edges in the graph can be represented as follows:

Total nodes: 9, count verified as 9 (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
Total edges: 15

**Answer:** 
```
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 15,
