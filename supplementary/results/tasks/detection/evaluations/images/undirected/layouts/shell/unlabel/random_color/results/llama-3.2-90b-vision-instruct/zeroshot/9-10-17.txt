**Step 1: Identify Input Information**

The input information for the graph is as follows:

*   The number of nodes: There are **9** nodes in the graph.
*   The number of edges: There are no sufficiently provided labeled edges in this image label. Based on the image and the presence of lines between each node which we may consider as edges, we can name and count the edges as follow: $(7,8),(1,4),(2,4),(4,5),(2,6),(1,6),(2,1),(3,1),(1,2),(5,6),(6,4),(1,7),(4,2),(4,6)$ 
*   Colors of nodes and edges: Colors of the nodes are purple, teal, dark green, green, pink. There are dark colored edges depressing interconnect nodes as well.



**Step 2: Analysis of the Output Values**

We can find these values as follows:

*   The label "number 1 of nodes" is the number representing the number of nodes, which is **9**.
*   The label "number 2 of edges" is the number representing the number of edges, which is **14**.



| field       | Values                                             |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| total_nodes | number 1 of nodes, which is **9**                  |
| total_edges | number 2 of edges, which is **14**                  |
| analysis    | There are **9** nodes and **14** edges in the graph. Node colors include purple, teal, dark green, green, and pink, among others. Edge colors include dark colors to depict connections between nodes.|



**Conclusion**

Based on the step-by-step calculations and analysis, the **JSONs** format output for the number of nodes and edges is:

JSONS code output:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 14,
    "analysis": "There are 9 nodes and 14 edges in the graph. Node colors include purple, teal, dark green, green, and pink, among others. Edge colors include dark colors to depict connections between nodes."
