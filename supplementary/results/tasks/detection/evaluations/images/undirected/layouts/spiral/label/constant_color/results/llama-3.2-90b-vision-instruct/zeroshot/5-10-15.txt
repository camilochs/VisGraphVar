**Step 1: Analyze the image**

In the analysis of the image, one can count the nodes which include 0 -9. The edges can be counted when one identifies two nodes connected by a line.

negative number

**Step 2: Report the count**

*   total\_nodes = 10 
*   total\_edges = 10 

**Step 3: Provide the analysis**

*   All nodes are in numbered circles, and all edges are depicted by a black line. 

**Answer**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 10,
   "analysis": "This is a directed acyclic graph with labeled nodes, represented as numbered circles, and black lines denoting the edges."
}
