To analyze the graph, we follow these steps:

*   **Identify the nodes**: 
   -   The nodes are represented as colorful circles. 
   -   The number of nodes is 9.
   -   The colors of the nodes are: dark green, tan, dark blue, gold, pink, light green, dark brown, light brown, and teal.

*   **Identify the Edges**:
   -   The edges are black lines connecting the nodes.
   -   The number of edges is 16.
