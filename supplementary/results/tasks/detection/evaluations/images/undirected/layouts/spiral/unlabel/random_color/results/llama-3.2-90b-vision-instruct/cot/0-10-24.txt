The graph is a simple network made out of ten nodes and 21 edges.

Ten distinct, colored circles define the nodes. They are colored teal, maroon (dark red), purple, beige (light orange), burgundy (dark purple), royal blue (dark blue), powder blue (light blue), red, dark gray-blue, and navy blue (dark blue, similar to the royal blue).

The edges are a set of 21 black lines drawn to connect the nodes to each other.

Here's the total number of nodes and edges in JSON format:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 21,
  "analysis": "The graph is a ten node, 21 edge network, as displayed in the image. Each of the ten nodes are colored in a different color, and are connected to other nodes by black edges. Eight nodes have three edges while two nodes have six edges."
}
```

I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.
