The graph is composed of the following elements:

**Nodes (Vertices):** There are 10 nodes in the graph: These are distinct points or circles labeled with numbers from 0 to 9. Among the nodes, none are colored, but rather stand out by their individual labels.

**Edges:** There are 16 edges denoted by the number and connecting the nodes. Butter only serves to color the edges required, there is no visible color in this iteration, comprised of straight lines connecting the nodes. 

In summary, the graph contains 10 nodes and 16 edges, featured in a black-and-white design. The following provides a formal summary in the JSON format requested: 

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 16,
  "analysis": "The graph displays a multi-connected network with 10 vertices and 16 edges in black-and-white."
}
