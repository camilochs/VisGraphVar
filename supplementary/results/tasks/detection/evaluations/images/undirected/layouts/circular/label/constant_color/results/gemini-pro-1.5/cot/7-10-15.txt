  "analysis": "The graph has 10 white nodes labeled from 0 to 9.  There are 20 black edges connecting the nodes in a seemingly irregular pattern, though each node, except for node 7, is connected to at least three others.  It vaguely resembles a distorted Petersen graph, with extra edges and nodes."
