The number of distinct nodes (in this case, vertices) is nine. 

These can be identified using the unique numbers from 0 to 9 within the various colored discs. 

Next, the total number of edges present is eighteen. 

These can be counted by examining the line segments that connect the vertexes in the above diagram. 

Each vertex has degree 2; in other words, two line segments connect to the vertex. 

The following is the completed JSON-formatted text:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 18,
   "analysis":  "There are nine distinct vertices within the diagram, each having one of nine distinct color: purple, gold green, teal, navy, sky blue, black, and orange."
}
```

A graph is called 'Eulerian' if it contains an Eulerian cycle. 

An 'Eulerian cycle' is a cycle that: 

(I) executes a closed path that begins and ends in the same vertex, 

and (II) contains every edge in the graph exactly once (i.e., each edge within the graph information above is 'traversed' just once).  

By examining the edges and their connections, we can conclude that this graph is not an Eulerian graph, since there is no possible way to find a path (or cycle) that meets conditions (I) and (II) previously mentioned for an Eulerian path.

The analysis of this graph provides a networked structure representing data flow or connected components. It features a distribution of colored vertices with face values ranging from 0 to 9 and neatly encodes visual properties (i.e., connections) in additional details.
