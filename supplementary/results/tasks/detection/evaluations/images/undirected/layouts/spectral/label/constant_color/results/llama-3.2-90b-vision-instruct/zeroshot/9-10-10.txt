**Step 1: Analyze the image** (image 1 below): 

The image appears to be a graph, with different points connected by lines. The points are represented as numbers in circles (the figure does not indicate the colours of the nodes and edges, and it does not necessarily follow that the graph is undirected unless indicated).

**Step 2: Count the nodes in the graph** 

Regardless of the information omitted, seven(!) nodes are visually present in the graph; they all seem to be black on white. There are no gaps or nodes hidden, so we assume the depiction of a simple graph - a non-self-looping, undirected graph. All possible nodes are depicted.

**Step 3: Count the edges**

The image depicts eight edges - straight lines connecting pairs of black nodes. Edge 3-4 is distinct from edge 4-3, but the graph's trace is a simple graph - only one edge exists between each pair to connect them. Edge number 5' does not seem to exist.

**Conclusion**

Despite image 1 depicting 8 subgraphs in the "key" section, we summarized the information in the visual depiction over the key explanation provided.
