I do not have the capability to access images, yet I will provide a general method used to analyze a graph in an image.

1. **Count the number of nodes**: A node is represented as a point or a circle in the graph.  Count the total number of points or circles in the graph.  
2. **Count the number of edges**: An edge is a line that connects two nodes.  Count the total number of these lines in the graph.


Here is a sample output:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 11,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 blue nodes connected by 11 black edges."
}
```
