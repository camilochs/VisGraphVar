The analysis of the graph in the image indicates the presence of **9 nodes** and **14 edges**. The graph exhibits a variety of edge connections between its constituent nodes, which have all been uniformly drawn in black ink. Based on this analysis, the following JSON format is applied to the data:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 14,
    "analysis": "The graph illustrates a set of nodes connected by black-colored edges, with 9 nodes and 14 edges visibly present."
}
```



This analysis concludes by reporting that the graph has 9 nodes and 14 edges, with the edges colored in black.
