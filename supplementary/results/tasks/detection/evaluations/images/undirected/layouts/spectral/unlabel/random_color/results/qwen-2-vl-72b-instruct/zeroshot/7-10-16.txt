The nodes are represented by circles and are colored in different colors including pink, red, light brown, light grey, green, light blue, and blue. The edges are represented by black lines connecting the nodes. The graph appears to be a connected network with a blue node isolated from the rest, connected only by one edge. The green and light grey nodes are central, with the green node connected to the isolated blue node."
