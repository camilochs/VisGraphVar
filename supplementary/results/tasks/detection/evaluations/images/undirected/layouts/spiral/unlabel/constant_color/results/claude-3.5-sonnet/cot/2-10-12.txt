Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image:

1. Identifying the nodes:
   - There are 9 distinct points or circles in the graph.
   - All nodes are represented by white circles with black outlines.

2. Identifying the edges:
   - There are 13 lines connecting the nodes.
   - All edges are represented by black lines.

3. Summarizing the findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 9
   - Total number of edges: 13
   - The graph appears as an interconnected network of white circular nodes joined by black lines, forming an irregular shape.

4. Formatting the answer in JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 white circular nodes interconnected by 13 black edges, forming an irregular network structure."
}
