**Step 1:** There are 10 visible nodes in the network.

**Step 2:** The total number edges in the network can be identified by counting the total number of line segments present in the graph.

The total number of edges in the graph is 17.

**Conclusion:** The number of nodes present in the graph is 10, the number of edges present is 17, and the network has a wide range of colors.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The network has 10 nodes with colors of red, blue, yellow, orange, purple, green, and brown, connected by 17 edges in black. It appears well-connected due to the seemingly random nature of the edges."
}
