**Step 1: Count the number of nodes**

The image provided appears to be a graph with nodes represented by circles. Upon closer inspection, we find there are nine (9) nodes in the graph. 

**Step 2: Count the number of edges**

These nodes are connected by edges, which are straight lines that move between two nodes. After examining the image, we find there are eleven (11) edges connecting the nodes in the graph.

**Step 3: Visual Inspection of Node and Edge Colors**

The graph consists of white nodal circles connected to each other with slender black lines, both drawn against a solid white background. 
**Conclusion and Final Answer**

After completing the node and edge counts, we are able to fill in the JSON-formatted answer containing our information:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 11, 
  "analysis": "The graph is made of nine white nodal circles, eleven black lines, and all points are plotted against a white background as displayed in the accompanying image."
}
