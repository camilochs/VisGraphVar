Analying the graph in the image reveals a total of 9 nodes (represented by circles labeled 0-9) and 10 edges (a combination of solid and dashed lines that connect these nodes). It is invalidated if nodes 0-8 and 2 have the same exact same y-value because they're shown as connecting to different x-positions.

**Number of Nodes and Edges:**

*   **Nodes:** 9
*   **Edges:** 10

Additionally, there appear to be 6 multi-edge grouped items between nodes 3 and 6, 6 and 8, node 7 and node 1, node 2 and node 5 and its split to two, node 0 to node 4 and another on node 4 itself.

**Analysis Summary in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9, 
    "total_edges": 10, 
    "analysis": "The graph contains 9 nodes and 10 edges, with a mix of solid and dashed lines. The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and they form a complex network with multiple connections between them. The edge colors are not explicitly stated, but they can be inferred as black or gray based on the image."
