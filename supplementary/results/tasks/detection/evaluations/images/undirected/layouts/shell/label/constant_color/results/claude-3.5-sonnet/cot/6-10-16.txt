Here's the analysis of the graph in the JSON format you requested:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 22,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes labeled from 0 to 9. The nodes are connected by 22 black straight edges forming a complex network structure. The graph appears to be non-planar and relatively dense, with some nodes having more connections than others."
}
