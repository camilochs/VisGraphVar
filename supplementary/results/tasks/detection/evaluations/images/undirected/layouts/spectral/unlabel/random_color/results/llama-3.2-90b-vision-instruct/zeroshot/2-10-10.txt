Here is the solution to the problem:

(1) We first count the number of nodes in the graph, which are represented by colored circles. There are purple red, green and light green nodes. There are 11 nodes in total.

(2) Next, we count the number of edges connecting the nodes. An edge represents a connection between two nodes. There are 10 edges in total.

(3) Based on the given data, we then create a JSON data object with the following structure:

```
{
"total_nodes": [number of nodes],
"total_edges": [number of edges],
"analysis": "[Brief description of the graph, including node and edge colors]"
}
```

Substituting the values we have obtained, the JSON representation of the graph data is as follows:

```
{
  "total_nodes": 11,
  "total_edges": 10,
   "analysis": "This graph is a tree, represented by 11 nodes and 10 edges, exhibiting a hierarchical layout with darker nodes and varying shades of green for node and edge coloring."
}
```
