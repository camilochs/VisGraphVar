**Step 1: Identify the Absolute Number of Nodes in the Graph**

Upon analyzing the image, there are ten (10) *distinctive nodes* in the graph described by unique colors: blue, grey, green, and purple. 

**Step 2: Calculate the Absolute Number of Links in the Graph**

We also identify the distinct lines with no crossing points each representing a link between any node with a connection in the graph. The absolute number of links identified in the given graph is **\Cbinom{10}{2} -3=\frac{10(10-1)}{2}-3=42\ ** given that the total lines can be equated to the combination formula for non-repetition that the formula includes repetitions that are erasures.

**Step 3: Analyze the Graph**

Based on visualization from the graph, the nodes and Edges are given by illustrations of colors in both orange and light green. Color adjacency on the set nodes can be bold or regular. There also exists intersecting line patterns.

**Conclusion**

The provided JSON string We output absolute numerical values of our graphs, where a successful subjective value of Node and Edge count absolute number case matching JSON integration for ease of understanding and easy response for later translations for database and file systems.
