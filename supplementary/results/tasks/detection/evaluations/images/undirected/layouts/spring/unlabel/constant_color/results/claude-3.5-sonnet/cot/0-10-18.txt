Following the steps you've outlined, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 15,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 white circular nodes connected by 15 black straight edges. The nodes are arranged in an irregular pattern, forming various triangular and quadrilateral shapes within the overall structure."
}
```

This analysis is based on carefully counting the distinct circular nodes and the lines connecting them in the image. The graph has a somewhat complex structure with multiple interconnections, creating an interesting network-like appearance.
