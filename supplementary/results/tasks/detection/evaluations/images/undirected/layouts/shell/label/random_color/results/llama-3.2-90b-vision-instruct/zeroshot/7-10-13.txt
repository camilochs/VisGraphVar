**Step 1: Count the total number of nodes in the graph.**

A quick glance at the image reveals a totaled 10 distinct points. From left to right, top to bottom, 0 through 9.

**Step 2: Count the total number of edges in the graph.**

Continuing the previous action, a quick count of the lines that connect the different points clearly show there are 11 connections present in the graph.

**Step 3: Complete the analysis.**

Wrapping up by summarizing what the analysis has discovered. The graph in the image has 10 nodes present which are marked with the numbers 0 through 9 located centrally on the node to which it refers. There are 11 edges connecting those 10 nodes. Those edges have not been differentiated in any particular way, as they have all been drawn in black. 

**Conclusion:**

The reported total nodes is 10.
The reported total edges is 11. 
The reported analysis is: "The graph in the image has 10 nodes numbered from 0 to 9, connected by 11 black edges, with no differentiation between them". 

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 11,
   "analysis": "The graph in the image has 10 nodes numbered from 0 to 9, connected by 11 black edges, with no differentiation between them."
} 
```

I hope this helps.
