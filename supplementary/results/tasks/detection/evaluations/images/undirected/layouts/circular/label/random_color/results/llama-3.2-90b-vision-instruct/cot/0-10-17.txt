Determining the Number of Nodes and Edges within an Image.

Unfortunately, no image has been provided for analysis. To assist you better, an image of a graph with distinct nodes and edges should be included in your request. 

Upon receiving the image, we can collaborate step-by-step to identify the nodes and edges, count them, note their colors, and summarize the findings in JSON format.

Here is a sample of how the answer should be formatted:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 0,
    "total_edges": 0,
    "analysis": ""
}
```

Please include the image to be analyzed.
