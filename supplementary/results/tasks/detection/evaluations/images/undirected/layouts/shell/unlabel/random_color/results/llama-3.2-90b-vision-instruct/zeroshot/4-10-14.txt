**Step 1: Identify the nodes in the graph.**

Nodes are represented by colored circles in the graph.

**Step 2: Identify the edges in the graph.**

Edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.

**Step 3: Count the total number of nodes.**

There are 9 nodes in total, each with a distinct color (red, green, purple, orange, yellow, dark green, light green, tan, and mint).

**Step 4: Count the total number of edges.**

There are 14 edges in total, connecting various nodes in the graph.

**Step 5: Analyze the graph.**

The graph consists of 9 nodes connected by 14 edges, featuring a diverse range of colors for both nodes and edges.

**Step 6: Combine the results in a JSON format.**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
