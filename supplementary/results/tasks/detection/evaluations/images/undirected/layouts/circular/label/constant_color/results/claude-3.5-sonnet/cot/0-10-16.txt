Following the steps provided, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 19,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes labeled from 0 to 9, connected by 19 black straight edges. The nodes are arranged in a roughly circular pattern, with some nodes more centrally located. The graph appears to be undirected, as the edges have no arrows indicating direction."
