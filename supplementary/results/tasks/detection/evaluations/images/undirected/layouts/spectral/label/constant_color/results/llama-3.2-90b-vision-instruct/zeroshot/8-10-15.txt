**Image Analysis Report**

The provided image represents a directed graph with a total of **9 nodes** and **10 edges**.

**Node Details**

*   Each node is uniquely numbered from 0 to 9.

**Edge Details**

*   The edges are colored in green.
*   Edges are directed and unweighted.

**Analysis**

The graph exhibits a mix of structures, including a path between its leftmost and rightmost parts. Furthermore, the left and right sections both contain cycles, whereas the middle part forms an isolated path that connects the two sides. The node size and edge thickness remain constant throughout the graph.
