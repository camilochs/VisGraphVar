Let's analyze the graph step by step according to the given criteria:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Nodes:**
   - The graph contains several distinct points or circles, each representing a node.
   - The nodes are all white in color.
   - Counting all unique nodes, there are 10 white nodes.

2. **Identify the Edges:**
   - The graph has lines connecting these nodes.
   - Each unique line segment connecting two nodes is considered an edge.
   - The edges are all black.
   - After carefully counting all the unique connections, there are 20 black edges.

3. **Summarize Your Findings:**
   - The graph has a total of 10 nodes and 20 edges.
   - The nodes are white, and the edges are black.
   - The graph appears to be a complex network graph with multiple connections between the nodes.

### JSON Formatting of Analysis:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 20,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white nodes and 20 black edges. The graph is a complex network graph with multiple interconnections."
}
