I'm sorry, but I cannot view images. However, I'd be happy to guide you on how to count the number of nodes and edges from an image. Below is the description of nodes and the edges.

*   Count the number of points in the image
*   Count the number of points that they connect to create an edge

The colors and size of the nodes can also be described to define the type of graph. Here you may see:

*   Node name
*   Node ID
*   Node Color
*   Node Weight

The colors and size of the edge can also be described to define the relationship between different points

Please see the Example JSON format below:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 12,  // Count from the picture
    "total_edges": 20,  // Count from the picture
    "analysis": "The graph contains 12 nodes, each represented by different point colors, and 20 edges. The points have different sizes and are connected to each other in a random manner on the screen. It can be seen that most of the points are connected more than once, resulting in a complex structure. These can include red, blue, green, etc."
}
