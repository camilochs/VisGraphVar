To determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph, we will follow the steps outlined.

**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

Upon examining the graph, we observe the following nodes:

*   A purple node
*   A red node
*   A dark green node
*   Three light green nodes
*   A teal node
*   A gray node
*   A blue node

This results in a total of **8 unique nodes**.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

Next, we identify the edges by counting the lines that connect each node. 

*   There are 2 lines connecting the purple node to other nodes.
*   There is 1 line connecting the red node to another node.
*   The dark green node has 3 lines connecting it to other nodes.
*   The three light green nodes have 6 lines combining with the other nodes.
*   The teal node and the gray node each have 3 lines connected to other nodes.
*   The blue node has 2 lines joining it with other nodes.

This results in a total of **16 unique edges**.

**Step 3: Summarize the findings**

The graph contains **8 nodes** and **16 edges**. The nodes are colored purple, red, dark green, light green, teal, gray, and blue, with the edges being black.

**Step 4: Format the answer**

Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 8,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "An undirected graph with 8 nodes (purple, red, dark green, light green, teal, gray, and blue) and 16 black edges."
}
```

This concludes our step-by-step analysis of the graph.
