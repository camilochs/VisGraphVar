The graph in the image contains eight separate dots, which we can label from left to right and top to bottom as (A-H). The four straight lines form edges, connecting nodes: AB, BC, BD, BE, BF, DE, DF, FG, and GH. Lastly, each line is black, and the colors of the nodes remain standardized to white.

If we want to write this data in the specified json format, the result would look like the following:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 9,
   "analysis": "This graph depicts a network without colored edges. Network nodes are depicted as white circles. Network edges are depicted as black lines. The nodes are labeled alphabetically from A to H."
}
```
