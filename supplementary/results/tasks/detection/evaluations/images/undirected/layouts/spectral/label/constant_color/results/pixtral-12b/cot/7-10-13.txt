To analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes:
   - The nodes are the circles labeled with numbers: 1, 0, 3, 5, 2, 9, 8, and 6.

2. Identify the edges:
   - The edges are the lines connecting the nodes. There are lines between:
     - 1 and 0
     - 0 and 5
     - 5 and 2
     - 2 and 9
     - 9 and 8
     - 8 and 6

3. Summarize your findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 8
   - Total number of edges: 6
   - The graph has primarily black-colored nodes and edges.

4. Format the answer:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 6,
   "analysis": "The graph has 8 nodes numbered from 1 to 9 and 6 edges connecting various nodes. The nodes and edges are primarily black-colored."
}
