To analyze the graph in the image step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the nodes**: Look for distinct points or circles in the graph. In this image, there are 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9.
   
2. **Identify the edges**: Look for lines connecting the nodes. In this image, there are multiple edges connecting different nodes without any specific color mentioned. Counting them requires tracing each line connecting two nodes. For simplicity, let's count them based on their terminations and intersections:
   
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
   - Node 4 is connected to node 5.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
   
   There are 13 edges.
   
3. **Summarize findings**:
   - Total nodes: 10
   - Total edges: 13
   - The graph appears to be an undirected graph with unlabeled edges and labeled nodes on a white background.

4. **Format answer**:

   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 10,
      "total_edges": 13,
      "analysis": "This is an undirected graph with 10 labeled nodes depicted as points labeled from 0 to 9, and 13 edges connecting these points. The graph is presented on a plain white background with no specific colors for the nodes or edges mentioned."
   }
