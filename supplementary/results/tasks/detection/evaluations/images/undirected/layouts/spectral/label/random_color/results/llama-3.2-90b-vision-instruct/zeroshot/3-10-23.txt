**Step 1: Analyze the image**

Since there's no image to analyze, I will provide a generic response. 

**Step 2: Counting data**

In a typical social network graph, there are circles typically representing entities and lines that define their relationships. Here is what I would look for:

*   Node 1: Entities represented by circles (typically colored)
*   Edge 1: Defining lines that correlate with Node 1

**Step 3: Provide response** 

Since there's no actual image provided I'll provide a generic text response; however, a list is not suitable for this prompt. 

Without analyzing the image using its graphical data, counting becomes impossible.

**Conclusion**

This response does not adhere to the prompt due to the lack of an image. Here's a sample response assuming the image were present:

**Generic Response**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 1,
   "total_edges": 1,
   "analysis": "A graph without colors only containing one node and one edge; making connections impossible for analysis."
}
```

It isn't always possible for answers to be precise in their results without all possible variables and data.
