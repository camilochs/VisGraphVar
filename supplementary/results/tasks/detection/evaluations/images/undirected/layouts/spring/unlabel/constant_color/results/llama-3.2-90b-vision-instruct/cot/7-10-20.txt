After analyzing the graph in the image, I counted a total of **10** distinct nodes and **13** edges within it. The nodes and edges are both drawn in black on a white background. The node count was determined by individually marking each unique point or circle in the graph, while the edge count was calculated by identifying and counting each unique line connecting these nodes. 

The data analysis results are presented in JSON format below, as requested.

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 13,
  "analysis": "The graph is composed of 10 nodes and 13 edges, all visualized in black against a white background."
