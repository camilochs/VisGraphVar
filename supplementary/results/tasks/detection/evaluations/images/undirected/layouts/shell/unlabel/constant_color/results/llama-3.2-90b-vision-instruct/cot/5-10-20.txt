**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   The image depicts a graph with distinct points or circles representing nodes.
*   There are 9 unique nodes in the graph.
*   All nodes are white in color.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   The graph features lines connecting the nodes, representing edges.
*   There are 12 unique edges in the graph.
*   All edges are black in color.

**Step 3: Summarize findings**

*   Total number of nodes: 9
*   Total number of edges: 12
*   The graph appears as a white background with 9 white circles (nodes) connected by 12 black lines (edges).
