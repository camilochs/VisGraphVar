**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Graph**

### Step 1: Identify the Nodes

* **Step 1a: Look for Distinct Points or Circles**
  There are distinct points/circles in the graph.
* **Step 1b: Count Each Unique Node**
  By counting each point/circle, we find there are 8 nodes.
* **Step 1c: Note the Color of the Nodes**
  The nodes appear to be white, as they are represented by empty circles, on a black line drawing.

### Step 2: Identify the Edges

* **Step 2a: Look for Lines Connecting the Nodes**
  There are lines connecting the nodes.
* **Step 2b: Count Each Unique Edge**
  By tracing each unique line connecting the nodes, we find there are 9 edges.
* **Step 2c: Note the Color of the Edges**
  The edges are black.

### Step 3: Summarize Findings

* **Total Number of Nodes:** 8
* **Total Number of Edges:** 9
* **Brief Description of the Graph:** A simple, undirected graph with 8 white nodes and 9 black edges, forming a network where any two nodes are connected by at most one edge.
