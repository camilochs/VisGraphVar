Let's analyze the graph step-by-step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. Identify the nodes:
   - There are 10 distinct points or circles in the graph. Each node appears to be white.

2. Identify the edges:
   - There are 17 distinct lines connecting the nodes. Each edge appears to be black.

3. Summarize your findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 17
   - The graph has white nodes connected by black edges and appears to be a interconnected network with various nodes having multiple connections.

4. Format your answer:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The graph appears as an interconnected network with 10 white nodes connected by 17 black edges. Each node appears to have varying degrees of connectivity."
}
