**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

Upon examining the image, there are 8 distinct points, and each point represents a node. Therefore, we found 8 unique nodes that are distinct from one another. There are also 4 unique node colors: green, purple, yellow, and blue.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

By looking carefully at the image, we observed 8 unique edges. These edges are distinct from each other and connect the nodes in the graph. Each edge is black in color.

**Step 3: Summarize the findings**

In total, the graph contains 8 nodes and 8 edges.

**Format the Answer in JSON**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 8,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 8 nodes which are colored green, purple, yellow, and blue, 8 edges, all of which are black in color."
}
```
