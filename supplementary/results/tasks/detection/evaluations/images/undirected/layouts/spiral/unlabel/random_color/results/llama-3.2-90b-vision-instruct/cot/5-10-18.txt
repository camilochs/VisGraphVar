The lines and nodes in this graph connect the nodes as follows:

The red node at the lower left is connected to three other nodes, the leftmost one (blue), the dark blue node second from the left, and the dark blue node second from the left. The leftmost blue node connects this dark blue node and the purple one third from the left. The red node at the upper, center left connects the black node at the top (upper left), the light dark blue node second from the top, and the blue node in front of it. The black node is connected to the blue node and the light blue node centered at the upper right, which is linked to the purple node in front of it. The light blue-purple node third from the left is connected to the purple node below, to the right, which is linked to the dark purple node at the bottom, center left. This dark purple node is connected to the blue node above it, which is connected to the light purple node in the center, level with the top of the black node, which, finally, is connected to the cyan node.
