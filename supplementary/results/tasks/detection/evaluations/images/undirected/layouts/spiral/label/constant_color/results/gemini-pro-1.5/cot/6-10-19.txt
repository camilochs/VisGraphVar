  "analysis": "The graph has 10 black nodes labeled 0-9 and 22 black edges connecting them in a somewhat irregular fashion. Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 are closely connected, while nodes 4 and 5 are connected to the former group and also to nodes 6, 7, and 8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 7. There don't appear to be any self-loops or parallel edges."
