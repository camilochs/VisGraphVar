**Step 1: Analyzing the Graph**

The graph in the image has several nodes and edges. 

*   The nodes are denoted by circles in different colors, including purple, black, green, dark green, blue, pink, and light green.
*   The edges are black lines that connect the nodes.
*   The graph is undirected, meaning:

    *   The edges have no direction, and 
    *   There are no arrows indicating the direction of the edges.
*   There are no isolated nodes (nodes with no edges).
*   There are no self-loops (edges that connect a node to itself).

**Step 2: Counting Nodes and Edges**

Based on the graph:

*   There are eight nodes:

    *   **Node 1 (Purple):** Located at the top left of the graph. 
    *   **Node 2 (Black):** Located at the top right of the graph. 
    *   **Node 3 (Green):** Located at the bottom right of the graph. 
    *   **Node 4 (Dark Green):** Located at the bottom right of the graph. 
    *   **Node 5 (Blue):** Located at the bottom right of the graph. 
    *   **Node 6 (Pink):** Located at the top center of the graph. 
    *   **Node 7 (Light Green):** Located at the bottom left of the graph. 
    *   **Node 8 (Grey):** Located at the bottom center of the graph.
*   There are nine edges:

    *   **Edge 1:** Connects Node 1 and Node 2. 
    *   **Edge 2:** Connects Node 1 and Node 3. 
    *   **Edge 3:** Connects Node 1 and Node 6. 
    *   **Edge 4:** Connects Node 2 and Node 3. 
    *   **Edge 5:** Connects Node 2 and Node 6. 
    *   **Edge 6:** Connects Node 3 and Node 4. 
    *   **Edge 7:** Connects Node 4 and Node 7. 
    *   **Edge 8:** Connects Node 5 and Node 8. 
    *   **Edge 9:** Connects Node 6 and Node 8.
