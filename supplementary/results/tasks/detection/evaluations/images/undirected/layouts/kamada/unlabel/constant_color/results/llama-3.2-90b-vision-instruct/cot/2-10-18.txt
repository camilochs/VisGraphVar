**Analysis of the Graph**

Upon examining the provided image, we can identify and count the nodes and edges as follows:

**Identifying Nodes:**
The graph contains distinct points or circles that represent nodes. These nodes are all uniformly colored in white with a black outline. Counting these nodes individually yields a total of 10 distinct points.

**Identifying Edges:**
The lines connecting these nodes represent the edges. Each line connects two nodes, and there are no duplicate lines between any pair of nodes. Counting these edges individually results in a total of 13 distinct lines. All edges are uniformly colored black.

**Summary and Findings:**
Based on the analysis, the graph consists of 10 nodes and 13 edges. The nodes are all white with a black outline, and the edges are uniformly black.

**Formatted Answer:**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 13,
    "analysis": "The graph features white nodes with a black outline, connected by black edges."
