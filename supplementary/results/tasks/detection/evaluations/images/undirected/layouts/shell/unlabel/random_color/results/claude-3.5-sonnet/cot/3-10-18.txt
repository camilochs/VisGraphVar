Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph and present the findings in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 22,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes in various colors (red, pink, purple, gray, green, dark green, olive, teal) connected by 22 black edges. The nodes are arranged in a roughly circular pattern, with each node connected to multiple others, forming a complex network structure."
