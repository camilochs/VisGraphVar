Here's the analysis of the graph in the JSON format you requested:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 26,
   "analysis": "The graph is a complex network with 10 white circular nodes arranged in a roughly circular pattern. The nodes are interconnected by 26 black straight edges, forming a highly connected structure. The graph appears to be undirected, as the edges have no arrows indicating direction."
}
