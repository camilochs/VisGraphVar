Based on the provided steps, we can identify the nodes and edges in the graph as follows:

1. Identify the nodes:
   - There are 9 distinct white circles representing nodes in the graph.

2. Identify the edges:
   - There are 8 lines connecting the nodes, with each line representing a unique edge.
   - Evidently, there are no dashed lines in this graph.

3. Summarize your findings:
   - The graph contains 9 nodes.
   - The graph contains 8 edges.
   - The colour of nodes is white, and the edges appear black.  
   


In JSON format, the response is:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 8,
   "analysis": "The graph has 9 white nodes and 8 black edges."
}
