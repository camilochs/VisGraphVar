**Step 1: Count the number of nodes**

A node is a point or a vertex in a graph. In this image, we can see multiple colored dots representing the nodes.

Number of nodes: 10

**Step 2: Count the number of edges**

An edge is a line segment connecting two nodes in a graph. In this image, we can see multiple lines connecting the nodes.

Number of edges: 16

**Step 3: Analyze the graph**

The graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The nodes are represented by different colors (purple, green, blue, brown, and light blue). The edges are black lines connecting the nodes.

**Conclusion**

The graph in the image has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The nodes are represented by different colors, and the edges are black lines connecting the nodes.
