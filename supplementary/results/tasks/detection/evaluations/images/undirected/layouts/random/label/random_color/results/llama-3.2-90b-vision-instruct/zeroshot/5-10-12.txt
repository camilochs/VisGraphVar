The image provided contains a representation of a graph that consists of 9 nodes and 12 edges. The nodes are represented by circles of various colors and are numbered 0 through 9, except for 8, which is excluded. The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.

To determine the total number of nodes, we can simply count the number of circles in the graph. There are 9 nodes in total.

To determine the total number of edges, we can count the number of lines connecting the nodes. There are 12 edges in total.

Therefore, the graph contains 9 nodes and 12 edges.

**JSON Response:**

   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 12,
   "analysis": "This graph consists of 9 nodes represented by colored circles and 12 edges represented by black lines connecting the nodes."
