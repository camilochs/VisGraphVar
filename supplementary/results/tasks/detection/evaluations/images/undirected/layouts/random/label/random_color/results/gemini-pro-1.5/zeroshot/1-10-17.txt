The nodes are colored differently: Node 0 is light purple, node 1 is light green, node 2 is dark blue, node 3 is coral, node 4 is dark purple, node 5 is olive green, node 6 is magenta, node 7 is pale yellow, node 8 is teal, and node 9 is bright pink. The edges connecting the nodes are black. The graph appears to be a type of complex network, and the specific type isn't immediately clear without further analysis of its connectivity pattern."
