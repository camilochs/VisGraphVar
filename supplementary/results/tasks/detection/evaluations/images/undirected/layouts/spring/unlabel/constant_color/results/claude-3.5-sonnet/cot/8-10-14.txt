Following the steps provided, I've analyzed the graph in the image. Here's the result in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 10,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 white circular nodes connected by 10 black straight edges. The nodes are arranged in a somewhat star-like pattern with one central node having multiple connections to other nodes. The graph is simple and unweighted, with no directional arrows on the edges."
}
