**Step 1: Analyze the Nodes**

The nodes are visible as standalone points. There are nine nodes present in the graph.

**Step 2: Identify the Number of Nodes**

The number of nodes is determined by counting each visible point. There are nine nodes present.

**Step 3: Determine the Number of Edges**

Count along each line connecting the nodes, starting at one edge and labeling each edge as one unique edge. There are 10 edges in the graph.

**Step 4: Identify Coloring**

The nodes and edges are black.

**Conclusion**

Here are the final answers:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 10,
   "analysis": "The graph consists a collection of 9 black nodes with 10 black edges"
}
