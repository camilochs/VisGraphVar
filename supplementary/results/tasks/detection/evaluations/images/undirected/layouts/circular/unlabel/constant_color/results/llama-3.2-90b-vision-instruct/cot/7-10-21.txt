**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

From the image, we can see that there are 9 distinct points or circles in the graph. Each unique node is counted and noted.


**Step 2: Identify the edges**

There are 16 lines connecting the nodes in the graph. Each unique edge is counted and noted.


**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

There are a total of 9 nodes and 16 edges in the graph. The graph appears as a complex network with black nodes and edges on a white background.

**Answer:**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "The graph is a complex network with black nodes and edges on a white background."
}
