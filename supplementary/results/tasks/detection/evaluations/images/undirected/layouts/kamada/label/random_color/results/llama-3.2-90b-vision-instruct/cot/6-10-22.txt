Upon analysis of the illustrated graph, the findings are as follows:

*   9 distinct nodes:
    *   Node 1: Blue
    *   Node 2: Brown
    *   Node 3: Green
    *   Node 4: Green
    *   Node 6: Yellow
    *   Node 7: Cream
    *   Node 8: Purple
    *   Node 9: Pink
*   13 distinct edges:
    *   No discernible colors or variances

**Summary:**

The distinct radius of the nodes are colored in a multicolored scheme (black is used as a background color, but none of the nodes are given this hue). All connecting edges are given the same black color.

Answer for the total number of nodes and edges, formatted using JSON, is:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 13,
    "analysis": "All connecting edges are the same black color. The nodes' radii are differentiated by way of a multicolored color scheme. When combined, the overall picture appears to be quite colorful."
}
