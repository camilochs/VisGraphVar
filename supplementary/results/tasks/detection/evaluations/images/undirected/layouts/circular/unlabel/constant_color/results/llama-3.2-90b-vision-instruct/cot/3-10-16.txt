The nodes of the graph are displayed as circles at intersections of lines, while the edges are lines connecting these nodes. This helps determine the total number of nodes and edges.

*   There are 10 nodes in the graph, and all of them are white circles.
*   There are 16 edges connecting the nodes, and all the lines are solid black.
*   The graph is an example of a finite, undirected graph, represented with circles for nodes and straight lines for edges. All nodes and edges are white and black, respectively. There are no self-loops (edges that connect a node to itself) or multiple edges (more than one edge between two nodes), making the graph a simple undirected graph.

The JSON response is:
