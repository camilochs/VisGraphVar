**Step 1: Transcribe the data from the image**

The graph in the image has **10 nodes** (1 through 0) and **9 edges** connecting them.

**Step 2: Analyze the color of the nodes and edges**

All nodes are white, and all edges connecting them are black.

**Conclusion**

The JSON format of the analysis is:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 9,
   "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes and 9 edges. All nodes are white, and all edges are black."
}
