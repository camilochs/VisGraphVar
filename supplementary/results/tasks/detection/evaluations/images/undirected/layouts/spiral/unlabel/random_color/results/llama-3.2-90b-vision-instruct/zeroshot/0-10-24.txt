I'm unable to analyze the image as I don't have the capability to access or view images. However, I can provide an example of what this answer would look like in the desired format if the nodes and edges were 8 and 14 respectively. I'm assuming a simple graph:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 8,
  "total_edges": 14,
  "analysis": "Assuming a graph with yellow colored nodes and black colored edges."
}
```

**Note:** The answer is an assumption as the image is not available to analyze.
