**Step 1: Identify the number of nodes**.

The following nodes in the graph appear as small circular blank blobs:

| Node | Count |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 1    |
| 1   | 1    |
| 2   | 1    |
| 3   | 1    |
| 4   | 1    |
| 5   | 1    |
| 6   | 1    |
| 7   | 1    |
| 8   | 1    |
| 9   | 1    |

There are 10 nodes in the graph.

**Step 2: Identify the color of each node**.

Each node appears to be blank. Therefore, there is no color to report in the analysis.

**Step 3: Identify the number of edges**.

The following edges in the graph are black and appear as straight lines that connect pairs of nodes:

| Edge | Nodes |
| --- | --- |
| 1    | 0    1 |
| 2    | 0    9 |
| 3    | 1    2 |
| 4    | 1    0 |
| 5    | 2    0 |
| 6    | 2    3 |
| 7    | 3    2 |
| 8    | 3    4 |
| 9    | 4    3 |
| 10   | 4    5 |
| 11   | 5    6 |
| 12   | 5    4 |
| 13   | 6    5 |
| 14   | 6    7 |
| 15   | 6    9 |
| 16   | 7    6 |
| 17   | 7    8 |
| 18   | 7    9 |
| 19   | 8    7 |
| 20   | 8    9 |
| 21   | 9    0 |
| 22   | 9    8 |
| 23   | 9    6 |
| 24   | 9    7 |

There are 24 edges in the graph.

**Step 4: Identify the color of each edge**.

Each edge appears to be black. Therefore, there is no information to report in the analysis.

**Step 5: Complete the analysis**.

There are 10 blank nodes connected by 24 black edges. This information can be reported in the subject JSON format:

```
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 24,
  "analysis": "The graph contains blank nodes connected by black edges."
}
