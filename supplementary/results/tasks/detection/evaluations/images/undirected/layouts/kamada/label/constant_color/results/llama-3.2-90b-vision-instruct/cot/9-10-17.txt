Analyzing the input image step-by-step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

**Step 1: Identify the Nodes**

* Looking at the input image:
	+ Nodes are darkened points numbered 0 to 9.
	+ There are 10 unique nodes.
	+ No other details are available.

**Step 2: Identify Edges**

* Lines connect some pairs of nodes.
* Number of edges determined by counting each line.
* No line connects to itself or does not connect two distinct nodes.

**Step 3: Summarize the Findings**

* Total number of distinct nodes = 10.
* Total number of unique edges = 17.
* Age nodes = black.
* All edges = black.

**Step 4: JSON format**
The following JSON object describes the graph:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "A graph with 10 nodes and 17 edges. All nodes and edges are black."
}
 ```
Conclusion:
This graph has 10 nodes and 17 edges. The black color is the only color used by the graph.
