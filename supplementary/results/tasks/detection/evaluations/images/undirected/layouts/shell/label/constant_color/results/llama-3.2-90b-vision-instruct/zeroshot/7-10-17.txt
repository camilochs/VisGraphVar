**Problem Statement:**

Analyze the graph in this image. Count and report the number of nodes and edges present. Provide your answer in the following JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": [number of nodes],
   "total_edges": [number of edges],
   "analysis": "[Brief description of the graph, including node and edge colors]"
}
```

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to carefully examine the graph and count the number of nodes and edges. Here are the steps:

1. **Count the Nodes:** Look for distinct points or vertices on the graph. These points are represented by numbers (0-9) in the given image. There are a total of 10 nodes.
2. **Count the Edges:** Edges are the lines connecting the nodes. We need to count each line separately. There are a total of 13 edges in the graph.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes, labeled from 0 to 9, and 13 edges. All nodes and edges are represented in black color."
}
```

By following these steps, we have successfully analyzed the graph and provided the required information in the specified JSON format.
