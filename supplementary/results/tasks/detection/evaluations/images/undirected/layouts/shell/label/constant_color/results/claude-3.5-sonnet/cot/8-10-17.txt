Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph and present the findings in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 22,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes labeled from 0 to 9, connected by 22 black edges. The nodes are arranged in a roughly circular pattern, with edges crisscrossing between various nodes to form an interconnected network."
}
```

This analysis is based on careful counting of the distinct nodes and edges visible in the provided image. The graph appears to be an undirected graph with no self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.
