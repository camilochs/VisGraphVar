**Step 1: Count The Total Number Of Nodes In The Image**

In the image we have the following nodes (there is no need to report every node):
 
          · 0
          · 1 
 
... all the way to

          · 9 

This means a total of 10 nodes.

**Step 2: Count The Total Number Of Edges In The Image**

By directly observing the image, you can see nine edges (edges between nodes in the same color will be treated as a single edge).

So, there are 9 edges.



**Step 3: Compiling The Result - "Total Nodes And Total Edges"**

With these two steps, we have enough information to compile our result:

*   There are 10 nodes.
*   There are 9 edges.

And so our result in JSON format looks like this:
```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 9,
    "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes and 9 edges. The nodes are represented with integers from 0 to 9. The edges are represented with lines in the following colors: blue, black, red, green, orange, purple. This graph represents a complete subgraph."
}
```

**Answer**: 
```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 9,
    "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes and 9 edges. The nodes are represented with integers from 0 to 9. The edges are represented with lines in the following colors: blue, black, red, green, orange, purple. This graph represents a complete subgraph."
}
