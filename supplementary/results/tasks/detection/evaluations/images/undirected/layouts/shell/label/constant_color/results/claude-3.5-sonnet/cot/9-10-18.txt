Following the steps provided, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 22,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white nodes, numbered from 0 to 9, connected by 22 black edges. The nodes are arranged in an irregular pattern, forming a complex network with varying degrees of connectivity between nodes."
}
```

This analysis is based on careful counting of the distinct nodes and edges visible in the provided image. The graph appears to be an undirected graph, as the edges don't show any directionality. The layout of the nodes doesn't follow any immediately recognizable pattern, resulting in a somewhat asymmetrical structure.
