Following the steps provided, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 15,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes connected by 15 black edges. The nodes are arranged in a roughly circular pattern, with edges crossing the interior of the circle to connect various nodes. The graph appears to be undirected and non-planar due to the crossing edges."
