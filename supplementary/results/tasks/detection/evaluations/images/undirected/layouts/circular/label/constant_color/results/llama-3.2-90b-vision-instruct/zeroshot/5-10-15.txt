**Graph Analysis**

### Step 1: Identify Nodes (Vertices)

*   Nodes are labeled from 0 to 9 in the graph.

### Step 2: Count Nodes

*   There are 10 nodes in the graph.

### Step 3: Identify Edges

*   Edges are labeled sequentially according to the source node followed by the destination node on its trail. Just use the visual edges for this data and distinguish numbers according to left to right and top to bottom. A pathtrail does not exist where there is not a line visibly.

### Step 4: Count Edges

*   An edge is present between two nodes if a line connects them.

*   The list of edges in the graph is as follows: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9).

*   There are 13 edges in the graph.

### Step 5: Provide Short Analysis

*   Logical analysis based on visual and intuitive observations.

### Summary of Findings

*   Final results in JSON format as specified.
