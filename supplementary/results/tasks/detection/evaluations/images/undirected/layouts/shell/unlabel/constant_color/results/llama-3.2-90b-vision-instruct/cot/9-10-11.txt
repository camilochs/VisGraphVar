**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   Look for distinct points or circles in the graph.
    *   There are 9 circles in the graph.
*   Count each unique node you see.
    *   There are 9 unique nodes in the graph.
*   Note the color of the nodes.
    *   The nodes are white.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   Look for lines connecting the nodes.
    *   There are lines connecting the nodes.
*   Count each unique edge you see.
    *   There are 12 lines connecting the nodes, however, there is 1 more edge attached to the bottom left node that intersects the line between the bottom and top left node. For the sake of this problem, we'll consider the intersecting edge one edge, not more. So there are 13 unique edges.
*   Note the color of the edges.
    *   The edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

**Step 4: Format your answer**

This data is presented in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 13,
  "analysis": "There are 9 nodes and 13 edges in the graph, with white nodes and black lines."
}
