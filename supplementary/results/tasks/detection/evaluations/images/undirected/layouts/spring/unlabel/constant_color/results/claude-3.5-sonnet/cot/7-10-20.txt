Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph and present the findings in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 18,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes connected by 18 black straight edges. The nodes are arranged in an irregular pattern, forming a complex network structure. The graph is not fully connected, but all nodes have at least two connections."
}
```
