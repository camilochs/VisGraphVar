Following the steps provided, I will analyze the graph in the image:

1. Identifying the nodes:
   - There are 9 distinct circles representing nodes in the graph.
   - All nodes are depicted as white circles with black outlines.

2. Identifying the edges:
   - There are 13 lines connecting the nodes, representing edges.
   - All edges are black lines.

3. Summarizing the findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 9
   - Total number of edges: 13
   - The graph appears as an interconnected network of nodes forming an irregular shape.

4. Formatting the answer in JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 white nodes with black outlines, connected by 13 black edges. It forms an irregular network structure with varying degrees of connectivity between nodes."
}
