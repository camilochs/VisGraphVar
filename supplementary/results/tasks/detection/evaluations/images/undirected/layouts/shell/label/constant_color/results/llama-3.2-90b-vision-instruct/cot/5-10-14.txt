I'm happy to help you with your task, but I don't have the capability to access or analyze images. I'm a text-based model, and I rely on text-based input to generate responses. Since I cannot view or interpret images, I am unable to perform the analysis you requested. 

Here's a general outline of the format and how you could fill in this information: 

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 8, // Insert the total number of nodes 
  "total_edges": 10, // Insert the total number of edges 
  "analysis": "Your graph has 8 nodes and 10 edges. The nodes are different colors, and the edges are different colors." // Describe the graph, including the colors of nodes and edges 
}
```
 
Please provide the information about the nodes, edges, and number of nodes and edges, and I can help you format your response in the specified JSON format.
