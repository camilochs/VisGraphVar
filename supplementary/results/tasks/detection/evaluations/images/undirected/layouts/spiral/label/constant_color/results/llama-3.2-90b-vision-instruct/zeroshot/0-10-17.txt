Based on the provided image of a simple undirected and unweighted graph consisting of ten nodes and 16 edges, the following analysis can be performed:

There are ten detectable nodes with nine identified by numbered circular nodes and one node is isolated at the bottom left, lacking an associated number.

The nodes, shown as circles, are identical, white on the inside and outlined in black. They are connected to one another by straight black lines, counting 16 connections in total.

**Here is the JSON format of the "Analyzed Graph Metrics":**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "A simple undirected, unweighted graph consisting of ten circular nodes connected by 16 total edges. All nodes are made white, outlined in black and all edges are made by black lines. One node is isolated at the bottom left from the other 9."
}
