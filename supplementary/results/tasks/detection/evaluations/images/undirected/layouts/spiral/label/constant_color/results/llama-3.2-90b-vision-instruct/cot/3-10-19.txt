```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 21,
  "analysis": "The graph appears black with white numbered circles for the nodes. It shows the nodes and edges on a white background devoid of any other information, numbers, or colors. The nodes are mostly connected, with a preponderance of edges overlapping together in the middle. Some edges only connect two of the nodes, while other edges can really complicate part of the graph."
