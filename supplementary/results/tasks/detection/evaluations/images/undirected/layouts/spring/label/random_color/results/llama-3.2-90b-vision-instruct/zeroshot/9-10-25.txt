**Step 1: Analyze the Image**

The image depicts a graph, which is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. In this case, there are multiple nodes with different colors: green, blue, pink, brown, red, peach, gray, and magenta. The nodes are joined together by lines, hence forming the edges.

**Step 2: Count the Number of Nodes**

There are nine distinct nodes visible in the image.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Edges**

There are edge links between the following node pairs:
Node 1 and node 2
Node 1 and node 4
Node 1 and node 3
Node 2 and node 1
Node 2 and node 6
Node 2 and node 7
Node 2 and Node 3
node 3 and node 1
node 3 and node 2
node 3 and node 8
Node 4 and node 1
Node 4 and node 6
Node 4 and node 7
Node 4 and node 0
Node 6 and node 2
Node 6 and node 4
Node 6 and node 0
Node 6 and node 9
node 7 and node 2 
node 7 and node 4
Node 7 and Node 5
node 8 and node 3
node 8 and node 0
node 9 and node 6
node 9 and node 5 and node 0
node 5 and node 9
node 5 and node 7
node 5 and node 0
Node 0 and node 4
Node 0 and Node 6
node 0 and node 8 
node 0 and node 9
node 0 and node 5

There are 23 edges connecting these node pairs.

**Step 4: Analyze Color Scheme**

The nodes of the image are colored following a fairly uniform pattern.

- 5 nodes (blue, green, brown, gray, magenta) have 3 edges each.
- 1 node (pink) has 4 edges.
- 2 nodes (peach – colored node and red – colored one) have 5 edges each
- The black colored node had 6 edges

The resulting dataset is presented in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 23,
  "analysis": "The graph is comprised of nine nodes of varying colors, primarily magenta, brown, teal, green, gray, pink, red, peach and black. There are three 'green nodes' among the nine in the dataset. Three or fewer magenta - colored nodes are visible. It is worth noting that multiple colors appear in the small set the graph contains. The most  of any color is three. In comparison, one node has four edges, six nodes, three nodes have 5 edges while one contains six"
}
