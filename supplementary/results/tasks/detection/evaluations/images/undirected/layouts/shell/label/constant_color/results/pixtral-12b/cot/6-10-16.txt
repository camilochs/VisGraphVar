Sure, let's go through the steps to determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph shown in the image.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Identify the nodes
- The nodes are represented by circles labeled with numbers from 0 to 9.
- Count of distinct nodes: 10
- All nodes are black.

#### Step 2: Identify the edges
- The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.
- Count each unique edge connecting the nodes.
  - Node 0 connects to: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  - Node 1 connects to: 4
  - Node 2 connects to: 3
  - Node 3 connects to: 2, 6
  - Node 4 connects to: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
  - Node 5 connects to: 0, 4, 7
  - Node 6 connects to: 0, 3, 4, 7
  - Node 7 connects to: 5, 6
  - Node 8 connects to: 0
  - Node 9 connects to: 0
- All edges are black.

#### Step 3: Summarize the findings
- Total nodes: 10
- Total edges: 18

### JSON Format Summary
```json
