Step 1: Identify the nodes: 9 nodes are present, and the color is not visible.

Step 2: Identify the edges: 10 edges are present, and the color is not visible. 

Step 3: Summarize your findings: The graph has 9 nodes and 10 edges. It looks like a random connected graph with black edges connecting white nodes. 

Step 4: Format your answer:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 10,
   "analysis": "The graph is a connected graph consisting of a total of 9 white nodes and 10 black edges. You can tell at first glance that the graph is a random graph."
   }
```
