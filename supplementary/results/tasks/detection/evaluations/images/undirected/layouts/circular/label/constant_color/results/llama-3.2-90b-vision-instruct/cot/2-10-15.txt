Shall we analyze the graph step by step?

**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

There are *10* distinct points or circles that make up the nodes of the graph. The color of the nodes is a light gray color.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

There are *17* unique line pairs connecting the nodes, making up the graphâ€™s edges. The color of the edges is black.

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

The graph has *10* nodes and *17* edges. The nodes of the graph are light gray circles and the edges are black lines.

**Step 4: Format your answer to match JSON requirements**

  {"total_nodes": 10, "total_edges": 17, "analysis": "The graph is made up of light gray points or circles, connected by black lines."}
