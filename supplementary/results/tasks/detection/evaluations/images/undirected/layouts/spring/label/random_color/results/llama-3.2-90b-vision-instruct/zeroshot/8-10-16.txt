The solution is as follows:

*   **Step 1: Counting Nodes and Edges**
    *   The number of nodes in the graph is 9.
    *   The number of edges in the graph needs to be counted manually by identifying all connections between nodes.
*   **Step 2: Determining Node and Edge Colors**
    *   Node colors are blue, green, red, purple, and teal.
    *   Edge color is black.

**Conclusion**

The final answer is presented in JSON format as required:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "The graph has 9 nodes connected by 16 edges. The nodes are colored blue, green, red, purple, and teal while the edges are black."
}
