Here is the detailing of the graph based on your query:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph has a total of 10 nodes and 14 edges. The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. The structure of the graph is fairly connected with nodes such as 8 and 9 acting as hubs with multiple edges linking to other nodes. Node 0 only connects to node 8 and node 1 connects to node 4 and 5.")
}
```

This graph showcases a sophisticated connection between the nodes with key interconnecting nodes in the central area of the graph.
