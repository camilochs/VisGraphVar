To identify the nodes in this graph, we can start by looking for distinct points or circles. In the provided image, there are 10 distinct nodes indicated by circles.

Next, we need to identify the edges by looking for lines connecting the nodes. By carefully counting each unique edge, we can see that there are 17 edges.

Finally, we summarize our findings and report the total number of nodes and edges.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 17,
  "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 black nodes connected by 17 black edges. The nodes are circles with a diameter of about 1/10 the size of the side of the graph. The edges are solid lines drawn between the nodes"
}
