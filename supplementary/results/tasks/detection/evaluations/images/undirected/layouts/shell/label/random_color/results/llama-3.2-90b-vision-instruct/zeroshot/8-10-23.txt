**Solution:**

**Step 1: Count the Number of Nodes**

*   The graph has 10 nodes, which are represented by circles with numbers ranging from 0 to 9.

**Step 2: Count the Number of Edges**

*   There are 19 edges in the graph, connecting various nodes.

**Step 3: Analyze the Graph**

*   The graph is an undirected graph, meaning that the edges do not have a direction.
*   The nodes are colored differently, with some nodes having multiple colors.
*   The edges are all black and of equal thickness.

**Conclusion:**

The graph has a total of 10 nodes and 19 edges. The nodes are colored differently, while the edges are all black and of equal thickness.
