What an engaging prompt to accompany this graph!

The code is intuitive and breaks down the process of identifying nodes and edges, thus making my graph analysis more efficient. I got the following results: 

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10, 
  "total_edges": 17, 
  "analysis": "A 10-node, 17-edge undirected graph featuring a spectrum of node colors, including yellow, purple, brown, blue, red, green, beige, grey, and two representations of white. The edges are strictly black."
}
```

This prompt model and dataset were excellent, and I appreciated having the opportunity to utilize them. If you have any additional graph data you want to work with, please DM me and I'll be happy to collaborate on a prompt.
