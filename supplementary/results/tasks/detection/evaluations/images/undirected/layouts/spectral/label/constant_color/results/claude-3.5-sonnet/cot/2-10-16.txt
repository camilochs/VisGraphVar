Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image and present the findings in the requested JSON format.

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes labeled with numbers 0-9. The nodes are connected by 14 black straight edges forming an irregular network structure. The graph appears to be undirected, as the edges have no arrows indicating direction."
}
