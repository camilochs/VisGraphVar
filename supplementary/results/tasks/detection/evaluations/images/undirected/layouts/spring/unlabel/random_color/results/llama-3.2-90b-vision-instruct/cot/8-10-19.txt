**TL;DR**: There are 10 nodes and 17 edges.

We analyzed the graph systematically according to the directions above, breaking down the steps below:

### 1. Identify the Nodes

*   There are ten nodes of different colors:
    *   1 Dark Brown Node
    *   4 Green Nodes
    *   2 Blue-Green Nodes
    *   2 Light Green Nodes
    *   and Blue Node

### 2. Identify the Edges

*   There are 17 lines connecting the nodes, or edges. 
    *   All the edges are black.

### 3. Summarize Findings

There are 10 nodes and 17 edges. The nodes are yellow, blue-green, green, and blue. The edges are black, connecting the different colored nodes. All the nodes have different numbers of lines connecting them, suggesting strengths in their connections. 

### 4. Format Your Answer

        {
       "total_nodes": 10,
       "total_edges": 17,
       "analysis":" The color coded graph depicts total of ten nodes of different hues connected by an arrangement of sixteen edges."
