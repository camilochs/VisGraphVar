**Step 1: Identify the nodes in the graph**

There are 10 nodes in different colors, not involved in any sharing.


**Step 2: Identify the edges in the graph**

There are 17 edges in different colors, not involved in any sharing.


**Step 3: Analyze the color configuration of the graph and its elements.**

There is a total of 13 colors used in this graph, including the 10 colors used for nodes (red, blue, lilac, green dark, brown, blue-greyscale green, yellow or orange, yellow-green turquoise dark green black, and S_curved beige), and 3 colors used for edges (green, blue, and lilac).


The final answer is:


```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "There is a total of 13 colors used in this graph, including the 10 colors used for nodes (red, blue, lilac, green dark, brown, blue-greyscale green, yellow or orange, yellow-green turquoise dark green black, and S_curved beige), and 3 colors used for edges (green, blue, and lilac). There are no sharing edges with distinct colors."
