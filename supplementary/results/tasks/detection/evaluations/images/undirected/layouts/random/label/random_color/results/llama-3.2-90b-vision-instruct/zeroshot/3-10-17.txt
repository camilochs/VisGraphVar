**Step 1: Analyzing the graph**

We can see that the graph is represented using circles and lines. 

*   The circles represent nodes.
*   The lines represent edges connecting the nodes.

Nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, giving us a total of 10 nodes.

There are the following ten lines:

*   from node 9 to node 5
*   from node 5 to node 2
*   from node 5 to node 9
*   from node 2 to node 3
*   from node 3 to node 7
*   from node 7 to node 9
*   from node 7 to node 8
*   from node 8 to node 0
*   from node 6 to node 0
*   from node 0 to node 1
*   from node 1 to node 6
*   from node 4 to node 6

We can see that there are 12 edges in the graph.



**Answer:**

```json

    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 12,
    "analysis": "This is a simple graph. All nodes are connected to each other by lines which represent edges. Nodes are not labelled here and are given colours by which nodes can be differentiated from each other. Edges can also be represented in different colours."
