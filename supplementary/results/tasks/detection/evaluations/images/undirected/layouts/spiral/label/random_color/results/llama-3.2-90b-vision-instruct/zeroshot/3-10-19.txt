**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image contains an undirected graph with 9 nodes and 15 edges. The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges connecting them are represented by black lines. 

*   The nodes are represented by colored circles, which may serve visual or functional purpose in the context of this graph.

**Step 2: Counting the number of nodes and edges**

Number of nodes(**n**): The image depicts 9 nodes.

Number of edges(**m**): The image has 15 edges in total.

  

**Step 3: Report the number of nodes and edges**

The nodes' colors are:

*   0 (blue)
*   1 (blue)
*   2 (black)
*   3 (orange)
*   4 (blue)
*   5 (green)
*   6 (green)
*   7 (purple)
*   8 (pink)
*   9 (yellow)

The edges' color is black.



**Step 4: Conclusion**

By counting, the image of the graph consists of 9 nodes (0 to 9) and 15 edges connecting them to form a non-planar graph.

**Answer:** 

```json
