To analyze the graph in the provided image step by step:

1. Identify the nodes:
   - The graph contains the following numbered nodes:
     - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
   - All nodes are represented using circles, and they are in black color.

2. Identify the edges:
   - The graph contains the following edges connecting the nodes:
     - Node 0 to Node 1
     - Node 0 to Node 2
     - Node 0 to Node 3
     - Node 1 to Node 3
     - Node 1 to Node 2
     - Node 2 to Node 3
     - Node 2 to Node 4
     - Node 2 to Node 5
     - Node 2 to Node 8
     - Node 3 to Node 4
     - Node 3 to Node 5
     - Node 4 to Node 5
     - Node 4 to Node 7
     - Node 5 to Node 6
     - Node 5 to Node 7
     - Node 6 to Node 7
     - Node 7 to Node 8
     - Node 8 to Node 9
   - All edges are black lines.

3. Summarize your findings:
   - The graph contains a total of 10 nodes.
   - The graph contains a total of 17 edges.

4. Format your answer in the provided JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The graph has 10 black-colored nodes and 17 black-colored edges. The nodes are connected in various manner showing a somewhat dense structure."
}
```
