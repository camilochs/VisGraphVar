In the given graph, we can see several points or circles. Each point represents a node while the line connecting the points represents an edge. Using the steps identified above, we analyzed the image. The total number of unique nodes identified were nine (9), and they were all black with white fill. Nine (9) unique edges were identified; they were all black.

Hence, the JSON format is: 

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 9,
  "analysis": "The graph has nine unique black nodes with white fill and nine unique black edges."
}
 
```
I hope that this helps.
