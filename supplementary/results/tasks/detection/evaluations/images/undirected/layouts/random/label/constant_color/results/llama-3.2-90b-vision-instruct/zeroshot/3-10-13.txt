**Image Description:**

The graph has 9 nodes or vertices and 13 edges or connections, comprising the following:

**Vertices or Nodes:** 
*   9 vertices total, labeled from 0 to 8, each represented by a circular symbol

**Edges or Connections:**
*   13 connecting lines


**Software Based Analysis:**
This graph has a fully connected subgraph consisting of more than 50% of the nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}, with one other pair [3, 5] only connecting to one node each (6 and 8, respectively)


**Color Detection:**

*   The graph is made up of black lines, white nodes, and a white background
