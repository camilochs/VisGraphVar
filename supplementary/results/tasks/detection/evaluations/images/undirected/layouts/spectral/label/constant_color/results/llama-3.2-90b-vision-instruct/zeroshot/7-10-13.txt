**Analyzing the Graph Image**

After examining the uploaded image, the following observations can be made:

* There are 3 nodes in total: 1 on the left side (node labeled as "3"), and 2 on the right side (not labeled).

**Conclusion**

Based on the graph structure, a total of **2** nodes are directly connected to each other. 

The final answer is:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 3,
    "total_edges": 2,
    "analysis": "A simple graph with two indirectly connected nodes and a standalone node."
}
```
