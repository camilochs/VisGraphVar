**Graph Analysis**

### Step 1: Count the number of nodes

*   There are 11 nodes in the graph.

### Step 2: Count the number of edges

*   There are 13 edges in the graph.

### **Step 3: Write JSON to report findings**

```json
{   
   "total_nodes": 11,
    "total_edges": 13,
    "analysis": "A connected graph that contains no colors."
}
```

**Answer:** 

```
{   
   "total_nodes": 11,
    "total_edges": 13,
    "analysis": "A connected graph that contains no colors."
}
```

Note that the graph is represented without specifying node and edge colors, as instructed.
