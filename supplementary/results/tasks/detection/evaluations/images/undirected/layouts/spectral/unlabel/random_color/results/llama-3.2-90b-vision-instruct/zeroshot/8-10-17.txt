**Step 1: Count the number of nodes in the graph.**

There are 9 nodes in the graph.

**Step 2: Count the number of edges in the graph.**

There are 12 edges in the graph.

**Step 3: Briefly describe the graph, including node and edge colors.**

The graph is a non-directed graph, each node specifically colored as follows:

* The top left node is **blue**.
* The top middle node is **pink**.
* The top right node is **navy blue**.
* The middle right node is **light purple**.
* Lower middle node is **green**.
* Lower left front node is **chocolate brown**.
* Lower left middle node is **dark brown**.
* Lower left rear node is **light blue**.
* Lower left node is **light purple**.

**Step 4: Provide answers in the appropriate specified format.**

   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 12,
   "analysis": "The graph is a non-directed graph with 9 color-coded nodes with edges in the color black."
