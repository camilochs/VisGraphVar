I'm not able to analyze the image as you have not provided it. However, I can guide you on how to analyze the graph once you have the image.

To analyze the graph, follow these steps:

1. Count the number of nodes: Nodes are the points or vertices in the graph. Count each individual point to determine the total number of nodes.
2. Count the number of edges: Edges are the lines that connect the nodes. Count each line to determine the total number of edges.
3. Observe the node and edge colors: Take note of the colors used for the nodes and edges in the graph.

Once you have completed these steps, you can provide the analysis in the required JSON format.

Here is a sample response:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes and 14 edges. The nodes are represented by white circles, and the edges are represented by black lines."
}
```
