**Step 1: Count the nodes in the graph.**

There are 10 nodes in the graph.

**Step 2: Count the edges in the graph.**

There are 17 edges in the graph.

**Step 3: Analyze the graph.**

The graph is a simple undirected graph with 10 nodes and 17 edges. All the nodes and edges are black.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, we can report the following statistics about the graph:

*   Total nodes: 10
*   Total edges: 17
*   Node color: Black
*   Edge color: Black

**Answer:**

```json
