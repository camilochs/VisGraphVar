The network depicted in this image has nine nodes.  Each node is represented by a number enclosed in a circle, and they are positioned in a non-predictable layout. The nodes are connected by 16 solid black lines (edges) of equal length. The network has no entry or exit point.

Answer: 

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "The total number of nodes is 9, and these are connected by 16 edges in a non-directed network."
}
```

The image is a simple depiction of a typical non-directed network with nodes and edges where all the connections are weighted equally, visually represented as all the same length. This information can help us determine its baseline complexity in the non-technical or technical sense. By counting the connections (edges) between the nodes and analyzing the line lengths and weight applied in displaying the line, it would appear that all of them are one factor or equal weight. The single-color black would indicate that the equivalent edge would exist to represent the single;.  

While these networks are not limited to the applications they have additional value applied to proxy or act in various instances as an Internet of Things(IoT) in modern applications performing various settings and actions based on the weighted existence of nodal relationships in a practical sense.

The network depicted in this image is a classic example of theoretical and classroom-trained graphical analysis. In real life, there are exactly 244 unfilled job positions in engineering alone that require the analysis of network configurations. These often pay 600,000 dollars per annum or more, depending on the complexity and functionality one can bring to research.
