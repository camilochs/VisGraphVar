Following the steps provided, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 white circular nodes connected by 14 black straight edges. The nodes are arranged in an irregular pattern, creating an interconnected network structure. Some nodes have more connections than others, resulting in a non-uniform distribution of edges across the graph."
