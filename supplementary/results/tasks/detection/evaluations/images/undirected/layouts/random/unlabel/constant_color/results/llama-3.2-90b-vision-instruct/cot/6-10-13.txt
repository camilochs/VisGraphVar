Analysis of the Graph:

* **Step 1: Identify the nodes**
	+ The nodes are small white circles.
	+ There are 9 unique nodes in the graph.
* **Step 2: Identify the edges**

	+ There are 14 unique edges in the graph.
* **Step 3: Summarize your findings**
	+ The graph consists of 9 white nodes interconnected by 14 black edges against a plain white background.
* **Step 4: Format your answer**
