Based on the image provided, this is a representation of a graph. It is a non-oriented and finite graph. In this non-oriented graph, there are 10 nodes which are colored differently and each node is assigned a unique digit label from 0 to 9.

Each node is connected with at least two other nodes, thus forming edges. Each edge is represented by a line labeled with a unique connection:

0-1,  0-5,  0-6,  0-8,  0-9,
1-2,  1-8,
2-3,  2-4,
3-7,  3-9,
4-5,  4-7,
6-7,  6-8,  6-9,
7-8,  7-9,
8-9

Thus, there are **17 edges** in this graph.

The final answer is:
