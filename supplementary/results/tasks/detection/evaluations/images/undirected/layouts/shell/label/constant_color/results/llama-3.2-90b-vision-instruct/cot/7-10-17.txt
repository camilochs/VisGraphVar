Calculating the Total Number of Nodes and Edges in the Graph

The image features a graph with nodes represented as circles and edges depicted as lines connecting these nodes. This graph appears to be an undirected graph, consisting of points and lines.

The nodes are labeled with numbers from 0 to 9, resulting in a total of 10 nodes.

### Edge Count

The graph contains multiple lines connecting the nodes. To accurately count the edges, it is essential to note that each line represents a single edge, regardless of the number of nodes it connects. For example, a line that connects three nodes should be counted as one edge, not three.

### Enumerated Edge List

1. Connects node 0 to node 1.
2. Connects node 1 to node 2.
3. Connects node 2 to node 3.
4. Connects node 3 to node 4.
5. Connects node 4 to node 5.
6. Connects node 5 to node 6.
7. Connects node 6 to node 7.
8. Connects node 7 to node 8.
9. Connects node 8 to node 9.
10. Connects node 9 to node 0.
11. Connects node 2 to node 0.
12. Connects node 3 to node 0.
13. Connects node 3 to node 6.
14. Connects node 4 to node 5 is already counted.

There are 13 unique connections or lines; therefore, there are 13 edges.
