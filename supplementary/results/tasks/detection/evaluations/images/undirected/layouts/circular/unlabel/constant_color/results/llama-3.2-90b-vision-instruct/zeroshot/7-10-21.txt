**Step 1: Determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph**

*   There are 10 nodes in this image of a graph. Nodes are identified as points where there are lines in the image. There are 2 such nodes with points in the image above.
*   There are 14 edges in this image of a graph. Simple edges are identified as straight line segments from any one node to another single node or the single edge between two nodes. In the image above, there are that many simple edges identified.

**Step 2: Getting Analysis** 

*   All nodes are solid black circles.
*   All edges have the same thickness as each other.
*   All edges are black solid straight lines.

**Conclusion:** This is a complete analysis of the graph presented. The answer in the appropriate output format is as follows: 

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "There are 10 solid black circular nodes with 10 solid black straight lines forming 14 edges."
}
