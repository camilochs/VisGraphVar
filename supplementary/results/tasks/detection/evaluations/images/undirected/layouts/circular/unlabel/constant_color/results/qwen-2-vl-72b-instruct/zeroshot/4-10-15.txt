To analyze the graph in the image, let's start by counting the nodes and edges.

1. **Nodes (Vertices)**:
   - There are 8 visible nodes in the graph.

2. **Edges (Lines)**:
   - There are 13 visible edges connecting the nodes.

Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 8 nodes and 13 edges. The nodes are represented by circles, and the edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes. The graph appears to be a simple undirected graph with no additional node or edge colors."
}
```
