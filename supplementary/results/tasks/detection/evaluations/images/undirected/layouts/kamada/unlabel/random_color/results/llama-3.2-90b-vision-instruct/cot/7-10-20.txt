Unfortunately, I cannot view the image to determine the number and colors of the nodes and edges. Here is a sample solution to the question. 

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 8,
  "total_edges": 12,
  "analysis": "The graph consists of eight distinct nodes represented by circles of various colors including red, pink, green, and yellow. Twelve edges, represented by black lines, connect the nodes, creating a web-like structure with some nodes having multiple connections."
}
```
