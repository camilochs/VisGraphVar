To analyze the graph in the image step by step, we will follow the specified steps:

1. **Identify the Nodes**:
   - The graph has nodes represented as circles.
   - By observing the image, we count and label the nodes as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0.
   - There are a total of 10 distinct nodes in the graph.

2. **Identify the Edges**:
   - The edges are the lines connecting the nodes.
   - Upon observation, we count and identify the edges connecting the nodes.
   - Each unique pair of nodes that are connected by a line constitutes an edge.
   - The edges are:  (1-2), (1-3), (1-5), (2-4), (2-6), (2-7), (2-8), (3-4), (3-5), (3-6), (4-6), (4-8), (5-6), (5-9), (6-7), (6-8), (6-9), (7-8), (7-9), (8-9), and (0-6).
   - There are a total of 20 distinct edges in the graph.

3. **Summarize the Findings**:
   - The total number of nodes is 10.
   - The total number of edges is 20.
   - The nodes are represented as circles and the edges are represented as straight lines connecting these circles.

4. **Format the Answer**:
   Here is the analysis presented in the specified JSON format:

   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 10,
      "total_edges": 20,
      "analysis": "The graph contains 10 nodes and 20 edges. The nodes are represented as circles, and the edges are represented as straight lines connecting the nodes."
   }
   ```

Thus, the detailed analysis of the graph yields the following information:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 20,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 10 nodes and 20 edges. The nodes are represented as circles, and the edges are represented as straight lines connecting the nodes."
}
```
