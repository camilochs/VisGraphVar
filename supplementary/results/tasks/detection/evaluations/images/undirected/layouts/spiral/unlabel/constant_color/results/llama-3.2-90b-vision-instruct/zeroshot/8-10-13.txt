I'm not able to view images, but I can provide you with a general outline of how to analyze the graph and report the results in the specified JSON format.

* The number of nodes in the graph is typically represented by the number of vertex/vertices in the web graph.
* The number of edges in the graph is typically represented by the number of connections between two distinct vertices in the graph.

Subject to seeing this, I can't give a precise answer; however, the following is a non-specific illustration of a web graph report in the specified JSON format.

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 10,
   "analysis": "The graph shows a complex network with multiple nodes and edges connecting them. The nodes are represented as circles, and the edges are represented as lines, indicating the relationships between the nodes. The graph appears to be undirected, as there are no arrowheads on the edges."
}
```
