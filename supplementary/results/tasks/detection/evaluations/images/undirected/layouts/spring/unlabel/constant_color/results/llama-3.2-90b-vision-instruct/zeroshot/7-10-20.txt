**Step 1: Analyze the graph for nodes and edges**

In this image, some nodes are only connected by a single line, representing an edge connecting two nodes. These can be seen in the top-right node and the bottom-left node.

There is a triangle node cluster at the center of the graph, which consists of three nodes, each connected to each other and thus forming four edges.

**Step 2: Count total nodes**

The graph has nine top and bottom nodes and also information that some nodes are clusters and are composed of more than one node. Counting the cluster's constituent nodes of the triple-connected nodes, one cluster consists of three nodes, counting for a total of:

$9 + 3 = 12$

Nodes.

**Step 3: Count total edges**

Nodes are counted by iterating through the graph and finding account for double-counted edges:

6 two-corner connections and 4 multi-node edge connections add up to 10 edges.

**Step 4: Summarise graph properties**

The graph is a network comprising 12 nodes and 10 multi-colored edges.
