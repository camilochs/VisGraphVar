**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   The graph contains distinct points or circles, which are the nodes.
*   There are 10 unique nodes in the graph.
*   The nodes are represented by circles and are colored white.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   The graph has lines connecting the nodes, representing the edges.
*   There are 17 unique edges in the graph.
*   The edges are black lines connecting the white nodes.

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

*   Total number of nodes: 10
*   Total number of edges: 17
*   The graph consists of 10 white nodes connected by 17 black edges.

**Answer:**
