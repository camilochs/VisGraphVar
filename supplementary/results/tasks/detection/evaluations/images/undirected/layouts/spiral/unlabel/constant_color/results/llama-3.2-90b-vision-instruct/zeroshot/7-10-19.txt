**Answer:**

The graph has 10 nodes, all of which are represented by vertices.

The graph has 16 edges, all of which are undirected as neither doubleweight nor arrowhead is visible. Both undirected edges and directed edges are represented as straight lines.

There are 10 undirected (i.e. bilinked) edges present as no arrowhead is visible.

In terms of graph structure, this is typically called a simple graph:  ordinal references do not exist, edges are unlisted and without labels.

Here is a JSON summary that I believe correctly reflects the summarizations above:

```json
{
 "total_nodes": 10,
 "total_edges": 16,
 "analysis": "A simple graph with undirected labeled edges and no ordinal references. Vertices appear as solid circles and no arrowheads are present, hence the graph is undirected. No edge labels are visible. Useful in network analysis to represent propagation of data, states in a finite state automata or transactions between human beings and digital objects."
