Based on the image, I observe 8 distinct nodes, labeled with varying Arabic numerals from "0" to "9", where some numbers are repeated. I do not notice any node colors, so I will leave out the color description. The nodes are connected by lines, which I've counted as 7. There are no visible edge colors.

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 8,
  "total_edges": 7,
  "analysis": "The graph appears in a black-and-white scheme with eight unique nodes and seven distinct edges. All nodes are white, with some bearing numerical labels, and all edges are black."
}
```
