**Step 1: Counting nodes**

*   The image contains 10 dots, each representing a distinct node, numbered from 0 to 9. For instance, the number 1 in the lower left corner corresponds to a node in the graph.

**Step 2: Counting edges**

*   Edges are represented as lines that connect two nodes in the graph.
*   The number of edges connecting the nodes in the image takes a bit more observation. For example, there are four edges that directly connect node 1. From node 0, we can visually trace the edges that directly connect to it and count accordingly, bearing in mind that each edge connects two nodes (two ends, meaning two edges per line).

**Step 3: Analyze the graph image**

*   Upon reviewing the image, there are 10 dark nodes. There are lines connecting each node in varying patterns, sometimes even multiple connections to the same line on a nod.

**Conclusion**

*   To determine the number of nodes, we found 10 nodes. There are 20 edges connecting these nodes.
*   All edge lines present appear to be drawn in black, and each node is represented as a number (0-9) in a black circle against a white background.
