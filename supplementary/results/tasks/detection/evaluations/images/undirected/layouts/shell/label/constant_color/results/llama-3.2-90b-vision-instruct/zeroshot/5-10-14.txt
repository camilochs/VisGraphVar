**Step 1: Analyze the image for node counts**

To determine the total number of nodes present in the graph provided, we will first find the count of nodes.



For this image, the number of nodes (circles in the image) is ten.



**Step 2: Analyze the image for edge counts**

To determine the total number of edges present in the graph, we will need to take note of all the lines connecting the nodes present.



In this image, the number of edges is ten.



**Step 3: Analysis of the graph**



The attached image shows a graph of ten nodes (circles in the image with numbers ranging from 0 to 9). All nodes and edges are black.



**Step 4: Create the JSON response**



Below is the JSON formatted data for this image.



{"total_nodes": 10, "total_edges": 10,"analysis":  "A 10 node graph with all edges and nodes of black color."}
