Sure, let's analyze the graph step by step.

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - The nodes are represented by circles labeled from 0 to 9.
   - Total nodes: 10

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - The edges are represented by the lines connecting the nodes.
   - After counting, the edges are as follows:
     - 0 connected to 8
     - 1 connected to 8
     - 2 connected to 5
     - 3 connected to 8
     - 4 connected to 2
     - 4 connected to 5
     - 4 connected to 9
     - 5 connected to 6
     - 5 connected to 8
     - 6 connected to 7
     - 8 connected to 9
   - Total edges: 12

3. **Summarize your findings:**
   - The graph consists of 10 nodes and 12 edges.
   - All nodes and edges are in black.

4. **Format your answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 12,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 10 nodes and 12 edges. All nodes and edges appear to be in black."
}
```
