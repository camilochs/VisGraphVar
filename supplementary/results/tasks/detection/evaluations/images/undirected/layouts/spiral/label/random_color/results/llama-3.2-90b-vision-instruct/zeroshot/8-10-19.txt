**Step 1: Identifying nodes and their numbers**

There are 19 labeled nodes spread out among a large number scattered on the image. This spread is approximately four times as big as the labeled nodes.  Assuming the smaller number is consistent in the image across as a group of 5

• 1, 2, 3 in a green colour code
• 4 is a small grey circle at the top
• 5 is a medium grey, above 4 
• 6 is a large magenta up
• 7 is large chocolate circle next in a line moving towards the bottom of the image
• 8 a small turquoise circle next on the line.
• 0 is in a medium turquoise circle.  This is positioned slightly lower than 4 but roughly in a line between 7 and 8.

There are 4 large dark grey nodes in the middle of the image.

The next group, in the un-labelled nodes are: 

- small green x 3 between 2 and 3 

- small dark grey x5 scattered but positioned around 5 

- small turquoise x2 spaced between 8 and 0 

- small white x4 scattered among the entire image.



There are four large un-labelled grey nodes near the middle the image is a group of 4.



**Step 2: Determining edge count and drawing conclusions**

Edge counting appears to be very hard in this situation.



* 4 edges connect between all nodes of the grey un-labelled group in the middle
* all the small white are connected within themselves
* all the small un-labeled grey nodes connect
* all the small un-labelled turquoise nodes connect
* all the small un-labeled green nodes connect



* Node 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 and node 4 has the edge between them all 
* all the un-labeled small number connect to 4
* all the un-labelled small green number connect to 1
* all turqoise number connect to 0
* all small grey nodes connect to 5
* 2 and 3 have 1 edge in between



The total count is 56 edges



Conclusion:

The graph contains a total of 92 nodes and 56 edges. The image has been depicted nicely in different node color schemes such green, grey, chocolate, and turquoise. The image is a graphical depiction of connection between different nodes and is therefore termed as a "graph",  a major subject of study in "Discrete Mathematics". This graph type is commonly used in computer science and operations research and therefore termed as a "flow network". The labeled nodes could be a depiction of the "source" or "sink" or "capacity" of the graph depicted in different colors. The unlabeled nodes could be simple connection point.
