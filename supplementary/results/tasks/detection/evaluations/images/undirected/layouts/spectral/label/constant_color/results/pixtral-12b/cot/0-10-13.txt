Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - The nodes are represented by circles with numerical labels.
   - The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

   Total nodes = 9

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.
   - The edges connect nodes as follows: 
     - Node 0 connects to node 3
     - Node 3 connects to node 7
     - Node 3 connects to node 9
     - Node 3 connects to node 8
     - Node 3 connects to node 2
     - Node 3 connects to node 6
     - Node 1 connects to node 7
     - Node 6 connects to node 5
   
   Total edges = 8

3. **Summarize your findings:**
   - Total number of nodes: 9
   - Total number of edges: 8
   - The graph appears to be in black and white, with black lines representing edges between the nodes.

4. **Format the answer:**
   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 9,
      "total_edges": 8,
      "analysis": "The graph comprises 9 nodes connected by 8 edges. The nodes and edges are in black and white."
   }
   ```
