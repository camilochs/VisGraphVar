Following the steps you provided, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 10,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 white circular nodes connected by 10 black edges. It forms an irregular shape with a central cluster and two extending branches, one longer than the other. The nodes are uniformly sized and the edges are straight lines of varying lengths."
}
```

This analysis is based on careful counting of the distinct nodes and edges visible in the provided black and white image. The graph has an interesting structure with a more densely connected central area and two extending parts, giving it a somewhat asymmetrical appearance.
