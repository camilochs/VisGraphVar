**Property to determine:** Total nodes and edges in the graph and a brief description of the graph's appearance.

**Relevant data:**

* The graph has 10 distinct points or circles, which are the nodes.
* Each node is labeled with a number from 0 to 9.
* The nodes are connected by lines, which are the edges.
* The nodes and edges are depicted in black against a white background.

**Calculation:**

1. Counting nodes: 10
2. Counting edges: 12

**Answer:**

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 12,
  "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges, all depicted in black against a white background."
}
```
