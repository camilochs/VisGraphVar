**Analysis of the Graph**

### Step 1: Counting Nodes

*   Upon examining the image, there are 9 distinct points or vertices where lines connect. These represent the nodes in the graph.

### Step 2: Counting Edges

*   The edges are the lines connecting the nodes. There are a total of 16 edges in the graph.


### Conclusion

The graph in the provided image can be described as follows:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "The graph has 9 nodes and 16 edges, all presenting themselves as black circles (nodes) and black lines (edges) against a white background. This contrasts with what the prompt initially suggested, as the nodes and edges are, in fact, black, not white."
}
```

*   **Total Nodes:** 9
*   **Total Edges:** 16
