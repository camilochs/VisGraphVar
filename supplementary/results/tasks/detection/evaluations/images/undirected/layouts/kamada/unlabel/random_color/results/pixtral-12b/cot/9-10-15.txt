Let's analyze the graph in the image step-by-step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Nodes:**
   - There are 8 distinct nodes in the graph.
   - The nodes are colored as follows:
     - One yellow
     - One blue
     - One green
     - One brown
     - One pink
     - One orange
     - One purple
     - One turquoise

2. **Identify the Edges:**
   - There are several lines connecting the nodes.
   - Counting the edges:
     - The nodes are interconnected, making it a bit complex to count straight away.
     - After careful inspection, the total number of edges is 10.

3. **Summarize Findings:**
   - Total Nodes: 8
   - Total Edges: 10

### Final JSON Format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 10,
   "analysis": "The graph has eight nodes of varying colors: yellow, blue, green, brown, pink, orange, purple, and turquoise. The nodes are interconnected with ten edges forming a non-linear graph pattern."
