**Property to determine:** Number of nodes and edges in the graph.

**Available data:**

* The graph consists of colored nodes connected by lines.

**Analysis:**

1. **Counting nodes:** Each colored dot represents a node. There are 10 nodes in total.
2. **Counting edges:** Lines connecting nodes are edges. There are 11 lines, hence 11 edges.

**Conclusion:**

The JSON format response is:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 11,
   "analysis": "The graph contains a variety of node colors, including red, blue, purple, brown, and teal. Edges are black and connect multiple nodes, forming a network."
}
