**Analysis of the Graph**

Based on the simplified image of a graph, we can identify the following nodes and edges:

**Nodes (9):**
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

**Edges (11):**
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 8), (5, 7), (7, 2), (8, 9)

**Directed vs. Undirected:**
The graph is undirected since it lacks arrowheads.

**Node Color:**
The nodes are not shown in different colors.

**Edge Color:**
The edges are not shown in different colors.

Given that there are multiple ways to draw a graph, we can create this graph with 9 nodes and 11 edges.

**Final Answer:**
```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 11
}
```
