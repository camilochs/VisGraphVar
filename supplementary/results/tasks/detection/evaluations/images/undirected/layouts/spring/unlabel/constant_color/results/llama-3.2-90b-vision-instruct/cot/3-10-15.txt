It appears you do not have an image to analyze. I will provide you with an example of how to complete this task using a typical graph.

In the image, there are eight visible nodes. These nodes are represented by small white circles.


The image depicts nine lines representing edges between the visible nodes. All edges appear to be solid black lines connecting the white nodes. This represents the total number of edges (9) in the graph.


This information can be summarized in the provided JSON format as follows:


```json
{
    "total_nodes": 8, 
    "total_edges": 9, 
    "analysis": "The graph displays eight white nodes and nine black edges."
}
```
