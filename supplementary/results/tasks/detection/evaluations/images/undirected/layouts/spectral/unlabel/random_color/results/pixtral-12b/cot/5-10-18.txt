Let's analyze the graph step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Nodes

1. **Yellow Node:** There is one yellow node on the left side of the graph.
2. **Blue Node:** There is a blue node situated in the middle.
3. **Green Node:** There is a green node at the top of the graph.
4. **Pink Node:** There is a pink node directly below the green node.
5. **Light Green Node:** There is a light green node just beside the pink node.
6. **Dark Blue Node:** There is a dark blue node at the bottom-right.

Thus, there are a total of 6 distinct nodes.

### Step 2: Identify the Edges

1. **Yellow Node to Blue Node:** There is an edge connecting the yellow node to the blue node.
2. **Blue Node to Green Node:** There is an edge connecting the blue node to the green node.
3. **Blue Node to Pink Node:** There is an edge connecting the blue node to the pink node.
4. **Blue Node to Light Green Node:** There is an edge connecting the blue node to the light green node.
5. **Blue Node to Dark Blue Node:** There is an edge connecting the blue node to the dark blue node.
6. **Green Node to Light Green Node:** There is an edge connecting the green node to the light green node.
7. **Light Green Node to Dark Blue Node:** There is an edge connecting the light green node to the dark blue node.
8. **Pink Node to Dark Blue Node:** There is an edge connecting the pink node to the dark blue node.

Thus, there are a total of 8 edges.

### Step 3: Summarize Findings

- **Total Nodes:** 6 distinct nodes.
- **Total Edges:** 8 edges.
- **Analysis:** The graph features variously colored nodes (yellow, blue, green, pink, light green, dark blue) interconnected with lines. The blue node acts as a central hub with multiple edges pointing to other nodes like the green, pink, light green, and dark blue nodes. The dark blue node has edges from the light green, pink, and blue nodes.

### Step 4: Format the Answer

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 6,
   "total_edges": 8,
   "analysis": "The graph features six nodes in different colors: yellow, blue, green, pink, light green, and dark blue. These nodes are connected by eight edges resulting in a star-like structure where the blue node acts as the central hub. Edges are primarily connecting the central node to other nodes, with one node connected by multiple edges and one additional edge connecting other nodes."
