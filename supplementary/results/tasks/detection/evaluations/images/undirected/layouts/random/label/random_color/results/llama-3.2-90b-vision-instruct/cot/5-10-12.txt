I'm sorry, but I cannot view the image and provide a detailed analysis of the graph step by step as you've requested. However, I can guide you through how you might approach this task if you have the image in front of you or can describe it.

1. **Identify the Nodes**: Look for distinct points or circles in the graph. Each unique point or circle represents a node. Count these, and note their colors if there's any variation.

2. **Identify the Edges**: Look for lines connecting the nodes. Each line represents an edge. Count these, and similarly, note their colors if there's variation.

3. **Summarize Your Findings**:
   - Count the total number of unique nodes identified.
   - Count the total number of unique edges identified.
   - Briefly describe the appearance of the graph, including the colors of the nodes and edges if applicable.

4. **Format Your Answer**: Present your analysis in the specified JSON format. For example, if your graph had 5 nodes, 6 edges, 3 green nodes, 2 purple nodes, black edges, and 1 green edge:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 5,
  "total_edges": 6,
  "analysis": "The graph features 5 nodes, with 3 being green and 2 purple, and 6 edges, one of which is green, the rest are black."
}
```

Remember, without viewing the actual image, this is a generic approach. Your specific counts and descriptions will depend on the details of the image you're examining.
