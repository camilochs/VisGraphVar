**Node Identification**

The image contains distinct points or circles that are visually discernible. Upon counting these unique points, we find a total of 10 nodes. All the nodes in the image are of the same color, which is white.

**Edge Identification**

The image features lines that connect the nodes. By counting each unique line, we determine that there are 18 edges in total. The edges appear to be identical in color, which is black.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the total number of nodes is 10 and the total number of edges is 18. The colors of the nodes are white and the colors of the edges are black. Here is the solution in JSON format:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 18,
  "analysis": "The graph contains 10 white nodes and 18 black edges."
}
