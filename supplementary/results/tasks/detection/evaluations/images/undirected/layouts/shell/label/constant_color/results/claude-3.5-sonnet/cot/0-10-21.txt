Following the steps you've outlined, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 28,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes labeled from 0 to 9, connected by black edges. The nodes are arranged in a roughly circular pattern, with edges connecting various pairs of nodes, creating a complex network structure."
}
```

This analysis is based on carefully counting the nodes and edges in the provided image. The graph is relatively dense, with many connections between the nodes, resulting in a complex network structure.
