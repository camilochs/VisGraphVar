The graph has a total of 10 nodes in the image. I counted the number of intersections on the lines in the image and there are a total of 16.

The analysis can be presented in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 16,
  "analysis": "The graph appears to be a black outline of a circle on a white background, featuring a series of intersecting lines and points. The nodes are represented by vertical dashes, while the edges are depicted as thick, thin lines."
}
```

The final answer is:
```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 16,
  "analysis": "The graph appears to be a black outline of a circle on a white background, featuring a series of intersecting lines and points. The nodes are represented by vertical dashes, while the edges are depicted as thick, thin lines."
}
