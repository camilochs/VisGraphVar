To analyze the graph in the image, we will follow the given steps and then format the analysis in the required JSON format.

### Step 1: Identify the Nodes
- Upon examining the graph, I count a total of 9 unique nodes. These nodes are represented as small circles.

### Step 2: Identify the Edges
- By examining the lines connecting the nodes, I can identify a total of 14 unique edges. These edges are represented as straight lines connecting the nodes.

### Step 3: Summarize Findings
- The total number of nodes: 9
- The total number of edges: 14
- The graph appears to be a complex network or graph. Both the nodes and edges are in black color.

### Step 4: Format the Answer
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph is a complex network with 9 nodes and 14 edges. Both nodes and edges are in black color."
}
