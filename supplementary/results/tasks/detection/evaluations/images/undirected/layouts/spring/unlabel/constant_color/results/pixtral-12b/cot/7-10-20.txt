Sure, let's go through the steps to analyze the graph in the image.

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - Look at the graph and identify the distinct points or circles.
   - Counting these points gives us a total of 10 unique nodes.

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - Look at the lines connecting the nodes.
   - Count each unique direct line (edge) that connects any two nodes.
   - In this graph, there are a total of 18 unique edges.

3. **Summarize the findings:**
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 18
   - The graph has nodes that are all white in color.
   - The edges are all straight lines without any particular color specified.

4. **Formatting the answer:**
   Here is the analysis in the specified JSON format:

   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 10,
      "total_edges": 18,
      "analysis": "The graph has 10 white nodes and 18 edges. The nodes are connected by straight edges without any specified colors."
   }
   ```
