**Step 1: Count nodes**:  
There are nine nodes in the image. They are located at what appears to be the coordinates (5,5), (1,9), (9,9), (9,1), (3,4), (8,4), (2,7), (7,7), and (6,6). However, note the coordinates were approximated based solely on visual relations to other points. Based solely on the image, the precise coordinates are not certain.

**Step 2: Count edges**:  
Based on the image we can see there are nine edges between the nodes. The connections are betweens the point at coordinates (1,9), (5,5), (8,4), (9,1), (6,6), and a point with coordinates (2, 7) approximately.  We are inferring the relationship.Here is a summary of the points from a previous analysis in the next steps.   (0, 4) = (0, 0); (1, 4) = (4, 1); (2, 2) = (4, 2); (3, 2) = (3, 0); (7, 2) = (5, 1); (6, 4) = (5, 0); (6, 3) = (3, 1).

In conclusion, this visual has nine nodes with seven of the point locations labeled as listed in the summary above. It appears to be nine edge for this graph as there is one cluster with four edge connections and another cluster, smaller, but it informs someone how many times the two smaller "nodes" were joined together with other points in blue of less equal likelihood of yellow or orange color states.



**Step 3: analysis** 
To put the description into words to begin here is "graph" we must explain our results images comprise new 'word image candidates,' which have possibility that they are really edge-cannot-form six graph candidates do not; either immediately break or soon reconnect after only passing through data on what determines whether an edge 'candidate.' Then, they use extra threshold on blue color as word recognition suggestionsGreedy list solved DFS of on Galbox36.

**Step 4: write JSON response** 
Based on the information from steps 1, 2, and 3, the json response is as follows:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 9,
