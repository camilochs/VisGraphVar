Based on the provided image, I counted a total of **9 nodes** and **8 edges**. The graph appears to be a simple, undirected graph, with each node represented by a circle and each edge represented by a line connecting two nodes. There are no edge weights or labels visible in the image.

Here is the analysis of the graph in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 8,
   "analysis": "The graph is a simple, undirected graph with 9 nodes and 8 edges."
}
