**Property to Determine:** Number of nodes and edges in the graph.

**Relevant Data:**

*   The graph consists of various colored nodes (green, red, yellow, teal, brown, purple, olive) interconnected by edges.
*   Count of nodes:
    *   Green: 4
    *   Red: 1
    *   Yellow: 2
    *   Teal: 1
    *   Brown: 1
    *   Purple: 2
    *   Olive: 0
*   Total nodes = 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 11
*   Count of edges by connecting two nodes at a time:
    *   From the graph, we can visually count that there are 13 edges connecting the nodes.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 11,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The graph is composed of 11 nodes with distinct colors including green, red, yellow, teal, brown, and purple. These nodes are interconnected by 13 edges, forming a complex network structure."
}
