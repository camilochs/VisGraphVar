*   **Step 1: Identify the nodes**
    *   Look for distinct points or circles in the graph.
    *   Count each unique node you see.
    *   Note the color of the nodes.
        *   The nodes are labeled 0 through 9 and are colored green, blue, purple, maroon, gray, light green, brown, orange, and yellowish-green.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   Look for lines connecting the nodes.
*   Count each unique edge you see.
*   Note the color of the edges.
    *   The edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

*   Report the total number of nodes.
    *   There are 10 nodes in the graph.
*   Report the total number of edges.
    *   There are 16 edges in the graph.
*   Briefly describe the graph's appearance.
    *   The graph has 10 nodes, each with a distinct color. The nodes are connected by 16 black edges.

**Step 4: Format your answer**

Present your analysis in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 16,
  "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes in green, blue, purple, maroon, gray, light green, brown, orange, and yellowish-green colors. The nodes are connected by 16 black edges."
}
