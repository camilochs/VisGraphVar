Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image:

1. Identifying the nodes:
   - There are 10 distinct circles (nodes) in the graph.
   - All nodes are white circles with black outlines.

2. Identifying the edges:
   - There are 13 lines (edges) connecting the nodes.
   - All edges are black lines.

3. Summarizing the findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 13
   - The graph appears as a network of interconnected nodes forming an irregular shape.

4. Formatting the answer in JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes with black outlines, connected by 13 black edges. The nodes are arranged in an irregular network pattern."
}
