**Analysis of the Graph**

To analyze the graph in the image, we need to count the number of nodes and edges present.

**Step 1: Counting Nodes**

Upon examining the image, we can see that there are several points or vertices connected by lines. These points represent the nodes of the graph. We can count them as follows:

* Node 1
* Node 2
* Node 3
* Node 4
* Node 5
* Node 6
* Node 7
* Node 8
* Node 9

There are a total of **9** nodes in the graph.

**Step 2: Counting Edges**

The edges of the graph are represented by the lines connecting the nodes. We can count them as follows:

* Edge 1-2
* Edge 1-3
* Edge 1-4
* Edge 1-5
* Edge 2-6
* Edge 2-7
* Edge 3-8
* Edge 4-9
* Edge 5-6
* Edge 6-7
* Edge 7-8
* Edge 8-9

There are a total of **12** edges in the graph.

**Conclusion**

Based on our analysis, the graph has **9** nodes and **12** edges. All the nodes and edges are black in color.

Here is the JSON format answer:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 12,
   "analysis": "The graph has 9 nodes and 12 edges, all in black color."
}
