Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - The graph contains several distinct points or circles.
   - Counting each unique node reveals that there are ten nodes in the graph.
   - All the nodes appear to be white in color.

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - The graph has multiple lines connecting the nodes.
   - Counting each unique edge reveals that there are 14 edges in the graph.
   - All the edges appear to be black in color.

3. **Summarize your findings:**
   - The graph has a total of 10 nodes.
   - The graph has a total of 14 edges.
   - The graph has a combination of evenly distributed connections and appears to be a connected graph without any apparent color patterns on the nodes and edges.

4. **Format your answer:**

   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 10,
      "total_edges": 14,
      "analysis": "The graph contains a total of 10 nodes and 14 edges. All nodes are white, and all edges are black. The graph appears to be a well-connected network."
   }
   ```
