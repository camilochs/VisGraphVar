Let's analyze the graph in the image to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. **Identify the Nodes:**
   - There are 11 distinct circles or points in the graph.
   - Each node appears to be white or unfilled.

2. **Identify the Edges:**
   - There are 14 unique lines connecting these nodes.
   - Each edge appears to be black.

3. **Summarize Findings:**
   - Total number of nodes: 11
   - Total number of edges: 14
   - Description: The graph has a complex structure with 11 nodes connected by 14 edges. The nodes are white or unfilled circles, and the edges are black lines.

4. **Formatting the Answer:**
   Here is the result in JSON format:

   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 11,
      "total_edges": 14,
      "analysis": "The graph has 11 white or unfilled circular nodes and 14 black edges forming a complex structure."
   }
   ```
