Here are the steps along with the actual analysis: 

**1. Identify the nodes:**
The graph in the provided image has 10 distinct nodes; all are points colored black. A point labeled 0 is at the bottom right, a 1 is top right, 2 is at the top, 3 is top left, 4 is mid left, 5 is mid right, 6 is bottom left and an 8 is directly under 0, a 9 is to the right of 8, and a 7 is below 6.

**2. Identify the edges:**
The image displays a line of 17 distinct edges, all are colored black, and are used to connect circles outlined in the same color.

**3. Summarize your findings:** The total number of nodes is 10 and the total number edges is 17. Furthermore, there are 2 unlabeled nodes, one at the bottom left and one directly above an 8 but we've identified all together for the analysis. I can now reroute the math json below:

   ```json
    {
        "total_nodes": 10,
        "total_edges": 17,
        "analysis": "Ten points connect seventeen lines; all are colored black. One unidentified node is located right of one labeled 4 and two are placed to the bottom left."
    }
    ```

Let me know if you have any more questions on identifying these graphs.
