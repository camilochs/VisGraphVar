**Analysis of the Graph**

The graph shown consists of 8 nodes and 7 edges.

* There are 5 nodes on the left side in a vertical formation, of which 2 are doubles, and a singleton at the far right of the graph.
* There are 7 edges in the graph, all of which are black.

The total number of nodes is 8 and the total number of edges is 7.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 8,
    "total_edges": 7,
    "analysis": "The graph has 8 nodes and 7 edges, all of which are black and in a vertical formation on the left side of the graph, with a singleton at the far right."
}
