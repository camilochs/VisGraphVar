  "analysis": "The graph is a bipartite graph with two sets of 5 nodes each. All nodes are white and all edges are black.  Each node in one set is connected to three nodes in the other set. Specifically, nodes 1, 2, and 3 (set A) share connections to 7, 8 and 9 from set B. Node 4 and 5 from set A shares connections with 9, 10 and 6 from set B. The remaining connections in the diagram are between nodes of sets A and B as follows: 1-6, 1-10, 2-6, 2-7, 3-8, 3-10, 4-6, 4-8, and 5-7."
