Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. Identify the nodes:
   - The graph has distinct points or circles, each containing a number from 0 to 9.
   - There are 10 unique nodes in the graph.
   - All the nodes are of the same color (black).

2. Identify the edges:
   - There are lines connecting various nodes.
   - Counting each unique edge:
     - Edge from 0 to 1
     - Edge from 0 to 2
     - Edge from 0 to 3
     - Edge from 1 to 2
     - Edge from 1 to 4
     - Edge from 2 to 3
     - Edge from 3 to 4
     - Edge from 3 to 5
     - Edge from 4 to 8
     - Edge from 5 to 6
     - Edge from 6 to 7
     - Edge from 7 to 8
     - Edge from 8 to 9
     - Edge from 9 to 0
     - Edge from 9 to 1
     - Edge from 9 to 2
     - Edge from 9 to 4
     - Edge from 9 to 5
     - Edge from 9 to 6
   - There are 19 unique edges in the graph.
   - All the edges are of the same color (black).

3. Summarize your findings:
   - The graph has 10 nodes and 19 edges. The nodes and edges are of the same color (black).

Here's the summary in the required JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 19,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 black nodes connected by 19 black edges."
}
```
