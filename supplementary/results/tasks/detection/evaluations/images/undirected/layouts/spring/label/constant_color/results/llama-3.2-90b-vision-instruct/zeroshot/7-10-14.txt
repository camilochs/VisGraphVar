**Graph Analysis**

The graph consists of 9 nodes, labeled from 0 to 9, and 10 edges that connect them. The nodes are represented by circles, while the edges are depicted as lines connecting these circles.

**Node Information**

*   Node Count: 9

**Edge Information**

*   Edge Count: 10

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph contains a total of 9 nodes and 10 edges. All nodes are represented by circles, and all edges are depicted as lines connecting these circles.

**Final Answer**

```json
