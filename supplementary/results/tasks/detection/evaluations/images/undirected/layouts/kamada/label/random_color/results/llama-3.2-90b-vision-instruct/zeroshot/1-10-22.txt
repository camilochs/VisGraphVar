**Step 1: Identify and count individual nodes and edges**

There are nine nodes in the graph. Each node has a distinct color (deep blue, midnight blue, brown, bright yellow-green, brick red, light rag blue, mint green, mud brown or coco, and a second bright yellow-green). Nodes are represented by small, colored circles.

**Step 2: Identify and count the color of each node and line**

Nodes 0, 1, and 3 have only one connecting line (connections to their adjacent node). Node 2 has five existing connections. Node 4 has two existing connections. Node 5 has one connection. Node 6 has one. Node 7 has three. Node 8 has two connections. Node 9 has three connections. 

**Step 3: Sum up and report the number of edges found**

There are 18 lines in the graph. Each line present represents an individual edge.

**Step 4: Interpreting the solution based on previous steps**

Given the information gathered in steps one through three, we can respond with the applicable JSON format.

**Conclusion in JSON format**

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 18,
  "analysis": "A graph presenting a net measuring nine total nodes and 18 edges connected among its structure."
}
