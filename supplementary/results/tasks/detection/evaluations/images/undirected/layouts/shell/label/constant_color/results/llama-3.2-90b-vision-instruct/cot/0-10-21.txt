**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   The graph in the image has 10 distinct points or circles.
*   Each unique node is counted once.
*   All nodes are black.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   There are multiple lines connecting the nodes.
*   Each unique edge between two nodes is counted once.
*   All edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

*   Total number of nodes: **10**
*   Total number of edges: **19**
*   The graph is a non-directed graph with black nodes and edges, representing connections or relations between the node entities.

**Step 4: Format your answer**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 19,
    "analysis": "The image presents a non-directed graph featuring 10 nodes interconnected by 19 edges. Both the nodes and edges are represented in black."
}
