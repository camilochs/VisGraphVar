I'm sorry, but I cannot see the image you are referring to. However, I can provide you with a general approach to analyzing a graph based on the steps you provided:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 0,
  "total_edges": 0,
  "analysis": "No image provided for analysis."
}
```

To follow the steps you provided, I would need to visually inspect the image, which I cannot do. If you can provide the image or describe it in detail, I would be happy to assist you in analyzing the graph.
