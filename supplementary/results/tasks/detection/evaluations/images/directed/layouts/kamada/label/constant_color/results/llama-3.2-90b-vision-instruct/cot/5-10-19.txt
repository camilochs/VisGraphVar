**Graph Analysis**

**Patterns of Interest:**

*   **Identification of Nodes and Edges:**
    *   The graph contains a series of interconnected points or nodes.
    *   These nodes are represented by circles with numbers inside them.
    *   The nodes are connected by lines, which represent the edges.
*   **Counting Nodes and Edges:**
    *   Upon examining the graph closely, we can see that there are 10 distinct nodes.
    *   Each node is uniquely numbered, ranging from 0 to 9.
    *   By counting the edges, we find that there are 16 lines connecting the nodes.
*   **Colors:**
    *   Notably, all the nodes and edges in this graph are drawn in black.
*   **Graph Appearance:**
    *   The graph appears to be a directed graph since the edges have arrowheads indicating direction.
    *   The background of the graph is plain white, providing a clean visual backdrop for the black nodes and edges.
