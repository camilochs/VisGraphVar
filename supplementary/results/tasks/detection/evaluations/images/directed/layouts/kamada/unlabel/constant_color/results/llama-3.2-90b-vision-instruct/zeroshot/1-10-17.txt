**Step 1: Count the nodes**

There are 10 nodes in the image.

**Step 2: Count the edges**

The directed edges in this graph include
*   An edge pointing from node 1 to node 2,
*   From node 1 to node 3,
*   From node 1 to node 5,
*   From node 3 to node 1,
*   From node 3 to node 4,
*   From node 3 to node 7,
*   From node 5 to node 3,
*   From node 4 to node 3,
*   From node 4 to node 6, 
*   From node 6 to node 7, 
*   From node 6 to node 8,
*   From node 7 to node 6,
*   From node 8 to node 4 and
*   From node 9 up to node 3 and node 5, where the latter edge wraps upward.
For a total of 15 edges.

**Step 3: Summarize the analysis**

The JSON data object that you asked for is

```json
{
"total_nodes": 10,
"total_edges": 15,
"analysis": "The count of nodes in the image is ten. These nodes are represented by small circles, and include no labels or annotations. The edges of this graph are directed and black in color, with a box surrounding their direction. The total number of edges is fifteen."
}
