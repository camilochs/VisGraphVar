**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   Look for distinct points or circles in the graph.
*   Count each unique node you see.
*   Note the color of the nodes.

    The following picture illustrates the identified nodes numbered from 0 to 9.

    [Image showing nodes labeled from 0 to 9]

    A total of 10 nodes were found with the following colors:
    *   Green
    *   Pink
    *   Orange
    *   Blue
    *   Purple

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   Look for lines connecting the nodes.
*   Count each unique edge you see.
*   Note the color of the edges.

    The following picture illustrates the identified edges.

    Next time I'll include the labeled edges pic

    A total of 13 edges were found with a single color:
    *   Black

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

*   Report the total number of nodes.
*   Report the total number of edges.
*   Briefly describe the graph's appearance.

    *   The total number of nodes: 10
    *   The total number of edges: 13
    *   The graph consists of 10 nodes and 13 black edges connecting the nodes of the following colors: Green, Pink, Orange, Blue, and Purple.

**Step 4: Format your answer**

*   Present your analysis in the following JSON format:

    ```
    {
      "total_nodes": 10,
      "total_edges": 13,
      "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes and 13 black edges connecting the nodes of the following colors: Green, Pink, Orange, Blue, and Purple."
    }
    ```

*Answer*:
