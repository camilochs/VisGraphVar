**Graph Information**

To determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph, we will follow these steps:

1. **Count each unique point or circle in the graph**.
1. Each point or circle is a node (**n**).
2. There are nine nodes visible.
3. Six distinctive node colors are observed: tan, baby blue, olive green, lime green, purple, and deep purple. Three of the nodes are a different shade of blue.
4. **Count each unique directed line (“→“) connecting the nodes**.
5. Each directed line is an edge (**e**).
6. There are 14 visible edges.
7. Only one color of edges is observed, which is black.

The data is presented in the formatted JSON that you requested:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 14,
  "analysis": "The bar graph displays nine nodes with six distinct colors".
}
