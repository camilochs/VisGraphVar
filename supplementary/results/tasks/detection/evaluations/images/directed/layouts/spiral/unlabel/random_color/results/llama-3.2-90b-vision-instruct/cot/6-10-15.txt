Analyzing the Graph Object

To determine the number of nodes and edges in the given graph object, we will follow a step-by-step process.

### Step 1: Identify the Nodes

* Look for distinct points or circles in the graph: The graph contains 10 distinct colored circles.
* Count each unique node: There are 10 unique nodes.
* Node colors:
	+ 1 brown node
	+ 3 purple nodes
	+ 2 green nodes
	+ 2 pink nodes
	+ 1 blue node
	+ 1 teal node

### Step 2: Identify the Edges

* Look for lines connecting the nodes: The graph contains 13 lines connecting the nodes.
* Count each unique edge: There are 13 unique edges.
* Red-colored edges.

### Step 3: Summarize Features

* Total number of nodes: 10
* Total number of edges: 13
* Brief description of the graph:
	+ The graph is a network of interconnected colored nodes.
	+ The nodes are represented by distinct colored circles, and the edges are represented by lines connecting these nodes.
	+ The graph has a total of 10 nodes and 13 edges.

### Step 4: Answer Format

JSON Format:
```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 13,
  "analysis": "The graph is a network of interconnected colored nodes, with 10 distinct colored circular nodes and 13 red-colored edges connecting them."
}
