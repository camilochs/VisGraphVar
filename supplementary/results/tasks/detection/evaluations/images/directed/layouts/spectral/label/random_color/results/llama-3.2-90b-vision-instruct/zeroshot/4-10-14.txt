**Step 1: Analyze the image**

After analyzing the image, we conclude that there are **10 nodes** in the graph.

**Step 2: Analyze the image**

After analyzing the image, we conclude that there are **14 edges** in the graph.

**Step 3: Analyze the image**

After analyzing the image, we conclude that the graph is represented as a connected graph, with all nodes connected. Some of the edges are color-coded. Blue is used for the node with label 5 and the edge from node 5 to node 0. Green is used to represent the edge between nodes 0 and 9. Node labels include: $4, 3, 5, 0, 1, 6, 8, 9, 2$. The image also has red edges between nodes 1 and 6, and between nodes 0 and 8.

**Conclusion**

The graph is a connected plot of 10 nodes, represented with 14 edges. The graph is color-coded to provide additional information in determining the nodes and edges involved.

**Count of nodes and edges**

According to the above conclusions, the final graph has a **node count of 10**, and an **edge count of 14**.
