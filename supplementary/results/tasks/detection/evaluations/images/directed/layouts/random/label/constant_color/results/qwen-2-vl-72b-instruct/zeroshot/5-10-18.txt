To analyze the graph in the image, let's count the number of nodes and edges, and describe the network.

**Total number of nodes**: There are 10 nodes in the graph, labeled from 0 to 9.

**Total number of edges**: There are directed edges connecting the nodes. By counting the arrows, there are 14 directed edges in the graph.

**Analysis**: The graph is a directed network, meaning that the direction of the edges matters. The nodes are labeled with numerical identifiers, and the edges have arrows indicating the direction of the relationship between the nodes.

Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph is a directed network with numerical labels on each node, and arrows indicating the direction of the edges."
}
```
