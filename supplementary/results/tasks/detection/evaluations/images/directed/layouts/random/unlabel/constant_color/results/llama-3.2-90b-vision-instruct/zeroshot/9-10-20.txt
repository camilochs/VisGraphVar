The maximum number of edges in a graph with N nodes is achieved only when the graph is complete. A complete graph has all possible edges present (every node is connected to and "points" at every other node). The maximum number of edges in a graph, E_max, can be calculated by:

E_max = (N × (N - 1))

Substituting N=9 into the equation yields the maximum number of edges in a complete graph with 9 Nodes, which appears to be the same number of nodes in the graph in this image:

E_max = (9 ×  (9 - 1))
= 9 ×  8  
= 72

graph has far fewer than the maximum number, with a total of 17 edges. side-by-side visual demonstration of the difference in edge quantity. 

**Is the graph complete?**

The graph in the attached image is clearly not a complete graph since not every node has a directed and undirected connection to every other node. The graph is directed due to the increase in line width and small arrow-length at the end of the edges where the arrow represents the endpoint.

**Node, Edge Count**

Directly counting the number, there are 9 nodes in the graph, as represented by the open circles. 17 of those nodes are connected via 17 edges that run between them.

**JSON Format**

Here is the requested information demonstrated in JSON format: 

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The provided image contains a directed graph, represented by open circles that signal identical nodes and arrows placed along the edges pointing to the nodes which the directed edges exit and enter, respectively. The lines are weighted/thick to differentiate between the direction 'source' and 'target'."
}
```

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
