**Step 1: Counting nodes in the graph.**

The nodes can be counted as follows:

*   Node 1 with a green color
*   Node 2 with a red color
*   Node 0 with a purple color
*   Node 5 (white) is counted as a single node that occurs twice but are the same object.
*   Node 3 with a green color
*   Node 8 with a purple color
*   Node 6 with an olive color
*   Node 7 with a light blue color
*   Node 9 with an olive green color
*   Node 4 with a blue color

**Step 2: Counting edges of the graph.**

The edges are counted as follows:

*   Node 0 to Node 1
*   Node 0 to Node 9
*   Node 1 to Node 2
*   Node 1 to Node 4
*   Node 2 to Node 3
*   Node 4 to Node 5
*   Node 5 to Node 6
*   Node 6 to Node 5
*   Node 5 to Node 7
*   Node 7 to Node 8
*   Node 8 to Node 9

**Step 3: Compiling the JSON format given.**

The graph has 10 nodes. The color palette consists of olive, olive green, blue, red, green, white, purple, light blue, dark blue and dark turquoise. The graph also has 11 edges.



*Final Answer:*

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 11,
    "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes with 11 edges in olive, olive green, blue, red, green, white, purple, light blue, dark blue and dark turquoise colors"
}
```
