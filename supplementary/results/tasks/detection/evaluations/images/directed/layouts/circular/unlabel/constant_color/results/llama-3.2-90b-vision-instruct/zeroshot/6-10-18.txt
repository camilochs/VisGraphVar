**Step 1: Visual Analysis**

b Nodes: Looking at the nodes in the graph, we can count each white circle as a single node. It appears that there are two nodes longer of incomplete circles extending out either way. 

Songs: Now targetting the edges of the graph we can see from visual inspection that there are two single edges.

**Step 2: Analyzing Node Edges**

Nodes with Zero Edges: Coming back to the two half-nodes we can see that these two nodes have zero edges each.

Nodes with One Edge: There are two whole nodes (but one is larger than the other), having only one edge each, apparently directed primarily to the upper edge.

Nodes with Two Edges: There are two small nodes to the left with two edges each. One goes up and the other angles by 90 degrees.

Nodes with Three Edges: In the middle right there are 4 nodes <ul><li>Two smaller nodes are isolated with two of their three edges going to their larger third circle in the middle.</li><li>The larger node in the middle top has three edges extending by 90-degree angles.</li><li>Another similar-looking larger node protrudes out only downwards.</li></ul>

Nodes with Four Edges: There are two larger-sized circles, one at the center and the other bottom left, from which four edges extend.

**Step 3: Analysis**

Based on the visual inspection of the graph it appears that there are nine nodes, four of which are smaller than the average and five of which are larger. There are eleven edges, seven directing out from one node to another and two where the edge (a single node) directly joins two nodes.

**Step 4: Answer in Required Format**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 11,
    "analysis": "The nodes are white circle-shaped and the edges black. The edges all extend out from one node and join the next except for one edge that connects two nodes. Large nodes in the middle have more edges extending that out at right angles. The edges are mostly straight and no edges are gouing over others."
