The graph analysis is as follows:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 16,
  "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes and 16 edges, all of which are black. The nodes are represented by circles, and the edges are represented by lines with arrows on them."
}
 ```
The final answer is: The graph consists of 10 nodes and 16 edges, all of which are black. The nodes are represented by circles, and the edges are represented by lines with arrows on them.
