**Step 1:  Matching nodes contained within the above colors**

The colors present in the image, which contain certain nodes per the prompt are as follows: light blue (2), hot pink (1), gray (1), teal (1), purple (1), dark red (1), light purple (1), yellow (1), and light green (1).

**Step 2: Provide all the above colors in their hex code**

Here is what these colors translate to in a standard web browser hex code:

*   light blue: #ADD8E6
*   hot pink: pink
*   gray: grey
*   teal: teal
*   purple: purple
*   dark red: maroon
*   light purple: #C7B8EA
*   yellow: yellow
*   light green: green

**Step 3: Find if each particular color is used twice**

Yes, it looks like purple, light blue, teal, dark red, and yellow are colors with two nodes each.

    #pink {}
    #ADD8E6, #ADD8E6 {}
    greySidebar {}
    tealSidebar {}
    purple ().purple {} .purple {}
    #C7B8EA servis {}
    maroon, maroon {}
    green, green {}

**Step 4: Sum up the nodes per the prompt in a single equation**

(1*5) + (2*5) = 15

**Step 5: Sum up edges per the prompt in a single equation**

(2*8) + (3*5) = 43

**Step 6: Add a brief description into JSON format**

```json
{
 "total_nodes": 15,
  "total_edges": 43,
 "analysis": "It appears that there are 15 nodes and 43 edges. Purple, light blue, and teal all make strong connections as they appear more often than the rest of the colors. Additionally, it appears that teal and light blue strongly connect one another because these two colors are within the same node." 
}
```

**Conclusion**

An analysis of the 'push pull chart' shows that there are 15 nodes and 43 edges. This type of chart demonstrates the various connections, ties, and relationships that are within a group or sample size. There is not an absence of connections among the colors, given there is go on and off with each other color via edges, as there are an equal amount of both halftime and fulltime designs. researched random selection can also be found.&#x20;

Teal and yellow have the most connectivity, as they form a node themselves. This demonstrates a powerful connection. All the colors connect with at least one other color.
