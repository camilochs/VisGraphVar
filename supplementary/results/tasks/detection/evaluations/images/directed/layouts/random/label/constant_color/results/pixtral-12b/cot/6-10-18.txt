Let's analyze the graph step-by-step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - There are clearly labeled circles in the graph.
   - The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9.
   - Total number of nodes: 10

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - There are lines connecting these nodes.
   - The lines represent the edges.
   - After a careful count, there are a total of 23 lines connecting the nodes.

3. **Summarize findings:**
   - The total number of nodes: 10
   - The total number of edges: 23
   - All nodes are labeled with distinct integers from 0 to 9.
   - The edges are all in black.

4. **Format the analysis in JSON:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 23,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 labeled nodes, with node labels ranging from 0 to 9. There are 23 edges connecting these nodes. All the nodes and edges are in black."
}
```
