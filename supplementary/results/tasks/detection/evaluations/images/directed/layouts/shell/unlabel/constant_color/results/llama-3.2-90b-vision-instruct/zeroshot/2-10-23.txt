**Graph Analysis**

To accurately analyze the graph, we will count the nodes and edges shown in the image.

*   **Counting Nodes**: The nodes are represented by circles. There are 9 circles in total.
*   **Counting Edges**: The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes. There are 14 lines in total.

**Reporting the Total Nodes and Edges in JSON Format**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 nodes and 14 edges, with all nodes and edges colored black against a white background."
}
```

This analysis provides a clear and concise overview of the graph's composition, including the number of nodes and edges, as well as a brief description of the graph's visual characteristics.
