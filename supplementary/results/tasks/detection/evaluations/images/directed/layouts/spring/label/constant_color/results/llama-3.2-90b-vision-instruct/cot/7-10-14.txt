The given graph is a directed graph with all black nodes and edges, containing no loops and no weights.
The graph contains 9 nodes, varying in size and shape. 
All 15 edges are similar in shape and size and are positioned to not overlap throughout the graph. 
They are directed from one node towards another and can originate or terminate in one of two spaces within that node or just outside a hollowed-out center.
