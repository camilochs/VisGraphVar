The colors of the nodes are: purple (node 0), orange (node 1), pink (node 2), orange (node 3), purple (node 4), green (node 5), blue (node 6), cyan (node 7), gray (node 8), and yellow (node 9). The nodes are connected by 13 edges, which are represented by black lines with arrowheads at the destination nodes. The graph appears to be a directed graph with no self-loops and multiple paths between nodes."
