Sure, let's analyze the graph step-by-step.

1. Identify the nodes:
   - The graph contains several distinct points represented as circles.
   - After counting them carefully, there are 8 nodes.

2. Identify the edges:
   - The graph has lines connecting these nodes, indicating edges.
   - Carefully counting the lines, there are 12 edges.

3. Summarize your findings:
   - The nodes appear to be white or empty circles.
   - The edges are black lines with arrows indicating direction.
