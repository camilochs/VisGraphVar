**Step 1: Count the nodes in the graph.**

*   The graph contains 10 nodes, labeled with numbers 0-9.

**Step 2: Count the edges in the graph.**

*   The graph contains 19 edges.

**Step 3: Summarize the analysis.**

*   All nodes in the graph are black, and all edges are also black.

**Conclusion:**

The final answer is:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 19,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 black nodes and 19 black edges."
