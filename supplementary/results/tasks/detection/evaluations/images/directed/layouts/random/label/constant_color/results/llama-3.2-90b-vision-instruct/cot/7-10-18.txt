Here is the step-by-step analysis of the graph in the image:

### Step 1: Identify the Nodes 

*   The distinct points or circles in the graph are numbered 0-9.
*   The nodes are unique and can be counted individually.
*   The nodes are all black circles with white numbers inside them.

Total Number of Nodes: 10

### Step 2: Identify the Edges 

*   The lines connecting the nodes are all black.
*   Each edge connects two different nodes.
*   Some nodes have multiple edges connected to them.

Total Number of Edges: 17

### Step 3: Summarize Findings 

*   Total Number of Nodes: 10
*   Total Number of Edges: 17

The graph's appearance is a simple black-and-white undirected network diagram with 10 nodes and 17 edges. The nodes are represented by black circles with white numbers inside them, and the edges are represented by black lines connecting the nodes.

To format this answer in JSON format, see below:
