Following the steps you've outlined, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 22,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes connected by 22 black edges. The nodes are arranged in an irregular pattern, with some nodes having more connections than others. The edges intersect at various points, creating a complex network structure."
}
```

This analysis is based on careful counting of the distinct circular nodes and the lines connecting them in the image. The graph is presented in black and white, with white circular nodes and black lines representing the edges. The arrangement is not symmetrical, and the connections between nodes vary in number, creating an intricate network structure.
