**Analysis of the Graph**

Since you didn't provide the image, I'm going to assume a hypothetical graph with 9 nodes and 10 edges. The nodes are labeled 0 through 9, and the edges are directed, indicated by arrows.

Here is the analysis in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 10,
  "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 nodes and 10 directed edges. The nodes are represented by numbered circles, and the edges are depicted as arrows connecting these nodes. The nodes and edges are black against a white background."
}
```

Please note that this analysis is based on hypothetical data since you didn't provide the actual image.
