**Graph Analysis**

**Step 1: Identify the Nodes and Edges**

* The graph consists of 9 nodes, labeled from 0 to 8.
* Each node is connected by edges to other nodes.

**Step 2: Count the Number of Nodes**

* There are 9 nodes in the graph.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Edges**

* To count the edges, we need to identify the connections between nodes.
* Each edge connects two nodes.
* After counting the edges, there are 14 edges in the graph.

**Step 4: Provide the Analysis**

* The graph contains 9 nodes and 14 edges.
* All nodes and edges are black.
