Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step:

1. Identify the nodes:
   - There are 9 distinct nodes in the graph.
   - All nodes are white.

2. Identify the edges:
   - There are 13 edges in the graph.
   - All edges are black.

3. Summarize your findings:
   - Total nodes: 9
   - Total edges: 13
   - The graph appears to be a directed graph (indicated by arrows) with a complex structure having white nodes and black directed edges.

4. Format your answer:

   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 9,
      "total_edges": 13,
      "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 white nodes and 13 black directed edges. The graph has a complex structure with multiple connections between the nodes."
   }
   ```
