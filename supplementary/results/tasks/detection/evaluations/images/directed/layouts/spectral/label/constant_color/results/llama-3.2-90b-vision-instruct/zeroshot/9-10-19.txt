**Graph Analysis**

**Step 1: Counting Nodes**

*   Node 0
*   Node 1
*   Node 2
*   Node 3
*   Node 4
*   Node 5
*   Node 6
*   Node 7
*   Node 8
*   Node 9

Total nodes: 10

**Step 2: Counting Edges**

*   Edge between Node 0 and Node 2
*   Edge between Node 0 and Node 6
*   Edge between Node 0 and Node 9
*   Edge between Node 1 and Node 3
*   Edge between Node 2 and Node 4
*   Edge between Node 2 and Node 7
*   Edge between Node 3 and Node 2
*   Edge between Node 4 and Node 7
*   Edge between Node 4 and Node 8
*   Edge between Node 5 and Node 0
*   Edge between Node 6 and Node 8
*   Edge between Node 7 and Node 0
*   Edge between Node 8 and Node 7

Total edges: 13

**Conclusion:**

The graph upon inspection contains a total of 10 nodes and 13 edges. All the nodes and edges are black in color, against a white background that serves as the graph's source color. 

**Report in JSON Format:**
