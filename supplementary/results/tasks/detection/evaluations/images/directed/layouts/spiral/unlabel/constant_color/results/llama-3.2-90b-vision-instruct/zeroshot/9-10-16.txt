**Image Analysis and Report**

Since the original request was not accompanied by an image, I will provide a mock example of what the analysis and report would look like.

### Analyzed Image

*   The analyzed image is a simple undirected graph.
*   Nodes are represented by white circles.
*   Edges are black and straight lines with arrowheads on both ends.

### Analysis and Report

*   **Total Nodes:** 9
*   **Total Edges:** 13

**JSON Format Analysis and Report**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 13,
    "analysis": "This graph consists of 9 nodes, represented by white circles, and 13 edges, represented by black straight lines with arrowheads on both ends."
}
