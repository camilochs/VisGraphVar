There are 10 nodes of a light grey color, each connected by multiple straight-edged lines (edges) that extend outward from the node. There are a total of 21 edges, all in solid black. The image depicts a random network with maximal connectivity to show the distribution and density of the connecting points called nodes.

The total number of nodes is 10. There are 10 nodes, each uniquely shaped with different lines extending from it - some are circles while others resemble arrows or trails as they fail directly outward away toward another connecting dot forming part of this self-contained map that covers most areas within its perimeter.
