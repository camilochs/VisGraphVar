**Graph Analysis**

The graph in the image can be analyzed as follows:

* **Number of nodes**: 10
* **Number of edges**: 19

This can be represented in JSON format as:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 19,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 10 nodes and 19 edges. The nodes are colored yellow, green, brown, pink, and purple, while the edges are black."
}
```

Note: Ensure you have the correct number of nodes and edges based on the image. The analysis focuses on the node and edge colors.
