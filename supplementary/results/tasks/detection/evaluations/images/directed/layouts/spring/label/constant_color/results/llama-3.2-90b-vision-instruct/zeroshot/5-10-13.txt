I'm not able to analyze the image as I'm a text-based model and do not have the capability to visually examine images. However, I can provide you with a general template for reporting the graph analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 0,
   "total_edges": 0,
   "analysis": "No analysis provided as I'm unable to access the image."
}
```

Please note that this is a default response, and you should refer to the actual image to determine the correct number of nodes and edges.
