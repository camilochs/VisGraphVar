**Step 1: Identify the number of nodes.** 

The nodes are the circles labeled with the numbers 0 through 9 inclusive. There are ten nodes.

**Step 2: Identify the number of edges.**

Edges are line segments starting from one node and ending at another. There are nine edges in this graph.

**Step 3: Summarize the colors.**

There are 10 geometric shapes: triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, heptagons, and octagons of the following colors: purple, yellow, green, grey, and blue.

**Step 4: Prepare the JSON format object**

*   Here is the necessary information in JSON format:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 9,
    "analysis": "There are 10 differently-shaped geometric objects of 5 colors"
}
```
