The graph image displays the following structure:

* Nodes: ten nodes are represented by small circles and are labeled "0," "1," "2," "3," "4," "5," "6," "7," "8," and "9."
* Edges: each node is connected to some other nodes with solid lines, where no edges are looped or coinciding.

By analyzing the image step by step, we can see that the graph contains ten nodes and a total of 16 unique edges. This step-by-step analysis can be formatted in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 circular-shaped nodes labeled 0-9 and 16 solid lines connecting some nodes to each other."
}
```
