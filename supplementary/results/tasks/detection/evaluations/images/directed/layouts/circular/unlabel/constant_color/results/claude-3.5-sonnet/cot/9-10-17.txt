Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image and present the findings in the requested JSON format.

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 white circular nodes connected by 17 black directed edges. The nodes are arranged in a somewhat irregular pattern, with some nodes more centrally located and others on the periphery. The edges form a complex network of connections between the nodes, with some nodes having multiple incoming and outgoing edges."
