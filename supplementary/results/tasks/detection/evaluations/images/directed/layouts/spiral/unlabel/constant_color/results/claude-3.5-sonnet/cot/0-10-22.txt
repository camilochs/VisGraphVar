I'll analyze the graph following the steps you provided:

1. Identifying the nodes:
   - There are 10 distinct circles representing nodes in the graph.
   - All nodes are white circles with black outlines.

2. Identifying the edges:
   - There are 21 lines connecting the nodes, representing edges.
   - All edges are black lines.

3. Summarizing the findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 21
   - The graph appears as an interconnected network of white circular nodes connected by black lines, forming a complex structure with multiple connections between nodes.

4. Formatting the answer in JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 21,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes interconnected by 21 black edges, forming a complex network structure with multiple connections between nodes."
}
