Let's analyze the graph step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. Identify the nodes:
   - The graph has several distinct points or circles.
   - By counting each unique node, we observe that there are 9 nodes in total.

2. Identify the edges:
   - The graph has several lines connecting the nodes.
   - By counting each unique edge, we observe that there are 15 edges in total.

3. Summarize your findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 9
   - Total number of edges: 15
   - The graph is a directed graph with nodes connected by directed edges. The nodes appear to be unfilled circles, and the edges are black.

4. Format your answer:
   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 9,
      "total_edges": 15,
      "analysis": "The graph is a directed graph with 9 nodes and 15 edges. The nodes are represented as unfilled circles, and the edges are black."
   }
   ```
