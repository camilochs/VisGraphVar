**Step 1: Identify the visual elements of the graph.**

There are two visual concepts in the graph. The nodes are represented by circles, and the edges are represented by arrows. The nodes and edges are both black.

Therefore, the edges are black and directed.

**Step 2: Count the nodes and edges.**

There are eight nodes (circles) and 14 edges (arrows).

**Step 3: Determine total nodes and edges.**

The total number of nodes in this network is 8.
The total number of edges in this network is 14.

**Step 4: Provide a brief analysis of the graph.**

The graph figure shows a directed graph. Because the graph contains nodes and directional connections, this graph may represent a social network.

**Step 5: Create a JSON format answer with total nodes, total edges, and the brief description.**

Using steps 1 to 4, the image can be analyzed in terms of nodes and edges as the following JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "black nodes and edges in a directed graph where the nodes and edges are black, possibly representing a social network"
}
