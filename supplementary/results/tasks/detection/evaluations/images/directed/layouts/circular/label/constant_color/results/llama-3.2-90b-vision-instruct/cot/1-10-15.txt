Analysis of the Graph in the Image. 

1.  We identified the nodes as nine discrete geometric points on the graph.

    *   The geometric points are represented in the shapes of circles.
    *   These geometric points are numbered by integers:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
    *   Each geometric point is a distinct color (red, blue, green, purple, pink, orange, yellow, black and brown).

2.  We identified the edges as straight and curved lines connecting each geometric point.

    *   There are twenty edges connecting all the geometric points in the graph.
    *   The color of the edges are black lines.

3.   Summarize our analysis: 

   *   The total number of nodes are nine (9).
   *   The total number of edges are twenty (20).

    The graph is comprised of nodes in the shape of circles. The circles are marked by distinct colors. The graph also has edges which are lines in black. In total, there are nine (9 nodes) and twenty (20) edges on the graph. 

Answer of the Problem: 

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 20,
  "analysis": "The graph contains nine distinct colored circle-shaped nodes, and twenty black edges connecting the nodes."
}
