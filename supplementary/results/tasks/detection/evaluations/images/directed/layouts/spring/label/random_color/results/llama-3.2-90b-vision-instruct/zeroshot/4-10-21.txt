Twenty-six edges are directed in various directions. The edges have varying directions throughout the image. 

**Step 2: Count the Nodes**

There are 9 nodes in the image. 

**Step 3: Count the Edges**

There are 25 edges in the image. 


**Step 4: Create Output in the JSON Format**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 25,
    "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 nodes and 25 directed edges. The appearance of edges seems arbitrary as they vary in orientation, suggesting that they express functional dependencies or more abstract relationships. The nodes are colored in nine different colors."
}
