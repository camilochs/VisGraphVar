Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image:

1. Identifying the nodes:
   - There are 10 distinct circles representing nodes in the graph.
   - All nodes are white circles with black outlines.

2. Identifying the edges:
   - There are 18 lines connecting the nodes, representing edges.
   - All edges are black lines.

3. Summarizing the findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 18
   - The graph appears as an interconnected network of white circular nodes connected by black lines, forming an irregular shape.

4. Formatting the answer in JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 18,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes with black outlines, connected by 18 black edges. The nodes are arranged in an irregular shape, forming an interconnected network."
}
