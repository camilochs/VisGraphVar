Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image and present the findings in the requested JSON format.

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 21,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes connected by 21 black directed edges. The nodes are arranged in an irregular pattern, forming a complex network structure. The edges are represented by arrows, indicating the direction of connection between nodes."
}
```

This analysis is based on careful counting of the distinct elements in the provided graph image. The nodes are clearly visible as white circles, and the edges are represented by black lines with arrowheads showing the direction of the connection. The graph appears to be a directed network with a moderately complex structure.
