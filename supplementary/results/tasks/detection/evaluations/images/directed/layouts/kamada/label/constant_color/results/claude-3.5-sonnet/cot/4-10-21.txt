   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes, numbered from 0 to 9. These nodes are interconnected by 17 black directed edges, forming a complex network structure. The edges have arrowheads indicating the direction of the connection between nodes."
}
