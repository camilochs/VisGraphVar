Sure, let's analyze the graph step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the nodes
- The nodes are distinct points or circles in the graph, and they come in different colors.
- Here are the colors of the nodes:
  - 2 nodes in red
  - 4 nodes in green
  - 4 nodes in blue (different shades)
  - 2 nodes in purple

The total number of nodes is 14.

### Step 2: Identify the edges
- The edges are the lines connecting the nodes.
- All edges are black.

### Step 3: Summarize the findings
- Total number of nodes = 14
- Total number of edges = 28

### Step 4: Format the answer

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 14,
   "total_edges": 28,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 14 nodes with different colors: red, green, and various shades of blue and purple. There are 28 black edges connecting these nodes, forming a complex interconnectivity."
}
