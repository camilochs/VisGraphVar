**Step 1:**

*   We cannot analyze a graph based on the request because no image of that graph was provided. 
*   For general guidance when the image does become available in order to determine the total number of nodes in the provided graph image, take a close look at the graph and identify each dot, denoting a node.
*   For guidance when the total number of edges, take a close look at the lines denoting connections in the image. 
*   For guidance when the total number of colors, a close examination of the colors of the lines and nodes can be done.

**Step 2:**

To get guidance on representing graph data in JSON, the following is an example of how the relevant data points in a general graph may look. Note that these numbers were randomly chosen: 

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 8,
  "total_edges": 25,
  "analysis": "The nodes are colored in blue, purple, red, green, and grey. The edges are black, connecting various nodes in different configurations." 
}
```

Any answer provided would be incorrect. The correct analysis of graph information in an image can only be done after examining that image.
