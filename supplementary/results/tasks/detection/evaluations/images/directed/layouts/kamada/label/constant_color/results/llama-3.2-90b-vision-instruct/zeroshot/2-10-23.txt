**Graph Analysis: Node and Edge Count**

The graph presented in the image comprises a network of nodes and edges. To quantify this network, we will identify the total count of nodes and edges.

### Node Count

• There are 9 nodes:
  • 0
  • 1
  • 2
  • 3
  • 4
  • 5
  • 6
  • 7
  • 8

### Edge Count

• There are 17 edges:
  • From node 0 to node 2
  • From node 0 to node 8
  • From node 1 to node 0
  • From node 1 to node 7
  • From node 1 to node 9
  • From node 2 to node 0
  • From node 2 to node 5
  • From node 3 to node 0
  • From node 3 to node 4
  • From node 4 to node 6
  • From node 5 to node 2
  • From node 6 to node 7
  • From node 7 to node 3
  • From node 7 to node 1
  • From node 8 to node 3
  • From node 9 to node 1

**Answer (in JSON format):**

{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 17,
  "analysis": "The graph is an undirected graph with 9 nodes and 17 edges. All nodes and edges are black in color."
