Sure, let's go through the graph step by step to perform the analysis.

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - The nodes in the graph are represented by circles.
   - Counting each unique node, there are a total of 11 nodes.

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.
   - Counting each unique edge, there are a total of 24 edges.

3. **Summarize your findings:**
   - The nodes are all white.
   - The edges are all black.
   - The graph appears to be a directed graph, indicating the presence of arrows on the edges.

4. **Format the answer in JSON:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 11,
   "total_edges": 24,
   "analysis": "The graph has 11 white nodes and 24 black edges. It is directed, as indicated by the arrows on the edges."
}
```
