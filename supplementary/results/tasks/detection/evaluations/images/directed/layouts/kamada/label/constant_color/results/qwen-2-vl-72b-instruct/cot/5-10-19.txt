To analyze the graph in the image, let's follow the steps:

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - The graph has 10 nodes labeled with numbers from 0 to 9.
   - The nodes are colored in black.

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - There are 14 edges connecting the nodes.
   - The edges are also colored in black.

3. **Summarize the findings:**
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 14
   - The graph is a directed graph with black nodes and edges.

4. **Format the answer:**

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 14,
  "analysis": "The graph is a directed graph with 10 black nodes and 14 black edges."
}
```
