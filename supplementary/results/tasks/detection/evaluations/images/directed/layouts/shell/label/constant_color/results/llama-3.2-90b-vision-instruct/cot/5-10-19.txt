**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   The graph contains distinct points or circles, each representing a node.
*   The graph has 10 unique nodes, numbered from 0 to 9.
*   All nodes are black.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   The graph is made up of lines connecting the nodes.
*   Upon counting, there are 14 unique edges in the graph.
*   All edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize findings**

*   Total number of nodes: 10
*   Total number of edges: 14
*   Brief description: The graph is a black-and-white, undirected graph with 10 nodes and 14 edges.

**Step 4: Format answer in JSON format**
