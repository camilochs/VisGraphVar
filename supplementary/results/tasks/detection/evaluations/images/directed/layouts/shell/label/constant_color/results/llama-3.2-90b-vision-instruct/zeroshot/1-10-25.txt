Analyzing the Graph in the Image
================================

The graph consists of nodes (points) and edges (lines connecting these nodes).

### Total Nodes

The graph features nodes labeled 0 to 9, resulting in a total of 10 nodes.

### Total Edges

To accurately count the edges, we can list them:

* Node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 9.
* Node 1 connects to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
* Node 2 connects to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
* Node 3 connects to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
* Node 4 connects to nodes 2 and 5.
* Node 5 connects to node 4 and 6.
* Node 6 connects to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
* Node 7 connects to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
* Node 8 connects to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
* Node 9 connects to nodes 0 and 8.

This results in a total of 19 edges.

### Analysis

All nodes and edges are represented in black, with node labels displayed in white. The background of the image is white.
