Based on the analysis of the graph, here is the detailed breakdown:

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - There are 8 distinct nodes in the graph.
   - The nodes are colored white.

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - There are 24 edges connecting the nodes.
   - The edges are black and have arrowheads, indicating directed edges.

3. **Summarize findings:**
   - The graph consists of 8 nodes and 24 edges.
   - The nodes are white circles, and the edges are black directed lines.

4. **Format the answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 24,
   "analysis": "The graph is a directed multigraph with 8 white nodes and 24 black directed edges. The edges have arrowheads indicating the direction of the connections."
}
