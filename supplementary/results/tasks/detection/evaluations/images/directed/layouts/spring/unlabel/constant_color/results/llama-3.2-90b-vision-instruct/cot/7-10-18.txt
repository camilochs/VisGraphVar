Analyzing the Graph in the Image

**Step 1: Identify the Nodes**

The graph in the image is a plain black and white image of an undirected graph with no additional colors or markings on the nodes. Visually, the nodes appear as small black circles. 

Upon examining the graph, there are **10 nodes**: five main nodes connected to multiple nodes and five others connected to some but not all of them.

**Step 2: Identify the Edges**

The graph's edges are the lines connecting the nodes. The nodes in this graph are connected by **14 edges**, each represented by a line between two of the circles.

**Step 3: Summarize Findings**

The graph has **10 nodes** and **14 edges**. All the nodes in this undirected graph are black circles, and the edges are black lines connecting two nodes.

**Formatted Answer**
