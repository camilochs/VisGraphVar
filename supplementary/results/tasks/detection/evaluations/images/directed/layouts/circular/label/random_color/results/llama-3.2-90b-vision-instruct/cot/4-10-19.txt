**Step 1: Identify Nodes**

*   The image shows a graph with distinct points, represented by circles.
*   Each circle has a unique number, ranging from 0 to 9, and they are colored in different shades of green, blue, and pink.
*   There are 10 unique nodes in the graph.

**Step 2: Identify Edges**

*   The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.
*   Each line is black in color.
*   There are 17 unique edges in the graph.

**Step 3: Summarize Findings**

*   The graph contains 10 nodes, each with a distinct number and color.
*   There are 17 edges, all of which are black in color.
