**Step One: Count the Number of Nodes**

We must find and identify all the nodes (also referred to as data points or vertexâ€™s), in this graph. In this graph there are 9 nodes, labeled as follows:

*   Node 0
*   Node 1
*   Node 2
*   Node 3
*   Node 4
*   Node5
*   Node 6
*   Node 7
*   Node 8
*   Node 9

**Step Two: Determine the Total Number of Edges**

We must count the number of connecting arcs/lines between the nodes that represent the flow between each node. In this graph, there are 17 edges.

**Step Three: Analyze the colors of nodes and edges**

In the provided graph, all nodes have unique colors for easy differentiation. Additionally, the color of the total number of edges appears to be black.

**Step Four: Write out the result in the specified format**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "There are 9 nodes in the graph with unique colors and 17 joining arcs also known as edges present in the the image. The bridges between these nodes are all in black." 
}
```
