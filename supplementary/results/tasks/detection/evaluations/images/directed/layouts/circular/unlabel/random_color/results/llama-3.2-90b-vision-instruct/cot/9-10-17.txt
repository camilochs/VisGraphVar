I'm unable to view images. If you are referencing a specific graph image located somewhere, please provide it, and I can assist. 

However, I can provide an example of what the JSON may look like with the data of a typical graph consisting of 8 nodes and 12 edges: 

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 8,
  "total_edges": 12,
  "analysis": "A graph with eight nodes of five different colors (red, green, blue, golden, and violet) that are connected by twelve black edges."
}
```

Please provide me with the image, and I can conduct the step-by-step analysis as requested.
