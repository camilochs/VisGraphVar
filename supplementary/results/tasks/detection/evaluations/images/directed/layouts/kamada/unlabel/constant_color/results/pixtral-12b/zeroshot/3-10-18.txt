Here is the JSON format representation of the graph:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 9 nodes and 13 edges. The nodes are represented as circles, and the edges are shown as directed lines pointing from one node to another. All nodes and edges appear to be black and white."
}
```
