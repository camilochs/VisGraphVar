The connected graph in the image consists of 10 distinct nodes ( points or circles ) and 17 edges ( connecting lines ). All the nodes and edges in the graph are black.

The graph appears dark due to the presence of black nodes and edges drawn on a white background. Based on this information, we can now format our answer as requested:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 17,
  "analysis": "The graph contains black nodes and edges set against a white background, giving it a dark appearance."
}
```

This formatted answer provides a clear summary of our analysis, including the total number of nodes and edges, along with a brief description of the graph's appearance.
