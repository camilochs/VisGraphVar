**Step 1: Counting Nodes.**

Count nodes by examining each circle in the image individually: 

There are 9 circles (nodes) in total, located in the top left, top middle, top right, right, middle right, middle, left, bottom left, and bottom right.

**Step 2: Counting Edges.**

To count edges, identify the lines connecting the nodes in the image. 

There are 12 lines in total, and each line represents an edge.

**Step 3: Describing Node and Edge Colors**

Node colors are not visible as the image is in a grayscale format. The same goes for the edges, as edge colors cannot be determined in a grayscale image showing black lines and white circles.



**Conclusion**

Scanning the image and taking the information into account results in the following data, presented in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 12,
   "analysis": "Gray and black scales containing nine white-colored-circle nodes connected by black cumulative lines. The black lines represent edges."
}
