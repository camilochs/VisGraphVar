  "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes, each with distinct colors including shades of green, blue, purple, pink, grey.  There are 22 directed edges connecting the nodes, all of them black. The graph appears as a somewhat circular arrangement of nodes with multiple crisscrossing connections and exhibits some degree of symmetry from side to side.  It's also a strongly connected directed graph as there exists a path from any node to any other node."
