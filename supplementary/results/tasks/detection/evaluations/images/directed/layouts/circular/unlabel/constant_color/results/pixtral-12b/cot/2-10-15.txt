Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - In the graph, each unique point or circle represents a node.
   - After counting, the graph contains 10 nodes.

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - These are the lines connecting the nodes.
   - By tracing the connections visually, we have the following edges:
     - Top node to right middle node
     - Top node to bottom-right node
     - Top node to middle node
     - Middle left node to bottom node
     - Right middle node to middle node
     - Middle left node to top-left node
     - Top-left node to bottom middle-left node
     - Bottom middle-left node to bottom middle
     - Bottom middle-left node to top-right middle node
     - Bottom node to top middle
     - Bottom middle node to top middle
     - Bottom middle-left node to bottom-left node
     - Bottom middle-left node to top right
     - Right top node to middle right node
     - Left top node to top middle
     - Bottom middle-left node to top middle
   - Total number of unique edges counted is 13.

3. **Summarize your findings:**
   - The graph has 10 nodes.
   - The total number of edges is 13.
   - The nodes are represented as circles without fill.
   - The edges are represented as continuous straight lines.

4. **Format your answer:**
   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 10,
      "total_edges": 13,
      "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes which are circles without fill. There are 13 edges, represented by continuous straight lines, depicting connections between the nodes."
   }
