Let's analyze the graph step by step.

1. Identify the nodes:
   - The nodes are the distinct numbers inside circles in the graph.
   - There are nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Total nodes: 10

2. Identify the edges:
   - The edges are the lines connecting the nodes.
   - Counting the unique edges, we have:
     - Node 0 to Node 5
     - Node 0 to Node 8
     - Node 1 to Node 6
     - Node 2 to Node 3
     - Node 2 to Node 6
     - Node 2 to Node 9
     - Node 3 to Node 4
     - Node 4 to Node 5
     - Node 4 to Node 6
     - Node 4 to Node 7
     - Node 4 to Node 9
     - Node 5 to Node 8
     - Node 6 to Node 8
     - Node 7 to Node 9
   - Total edges: 14

3. Summary of the graph:
   - The graph contains 10 nodes, each labeled with a unique number from 0 to 9.
   - It has 14 edges, represented by lines connecting the nodes.
   - The nodes and edges are all in black.
