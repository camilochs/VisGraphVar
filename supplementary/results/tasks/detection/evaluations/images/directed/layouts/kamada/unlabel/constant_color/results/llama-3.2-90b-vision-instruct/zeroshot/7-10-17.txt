**Step 1: Counting the nodes**

The nodes are the individual points on the graph that form the overall shape. Count each of them:
This includes nodes marked by white circles and ones that lack these symbols. There are 9 in total.

**Step 2: Counting the edges**

The edges are the lines on the graph that connect the vertices:
There are 10.

**Step 3: Formulating a description and arranging numbers into the JSON format**
The nodes are individual points and the edges are lines that connect them. All nodes and edges are black.

**Answer:** ```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 10,
  "analysis":
    "The graph consists of individual black points (nodes) with additional uncolored nodes that form the shape, connected by black lines (edges)"
}
```



The solution is complete.
