**Number of nodes and edges in the graph**

With 0 to 9 labeled, we can see a total of 10 nodes present within the graph. Surrounding the segmented circle in the center, 17 straight lines connect the nodes, forming a complex network. As a result, we can count 17 edges within the graph.

**Answer in JSON Format:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 10 dark gray nodes and 17 dark gray edges. The seamed connecting loop in the center appears in translucent white and does not connect to any other graphs".
}
