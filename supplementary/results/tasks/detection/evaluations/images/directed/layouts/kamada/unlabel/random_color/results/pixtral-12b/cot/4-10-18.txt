   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 9 nodes and 17 edges. The nodes are colored as follows: one is light green, one is light blue, one is red, one is pink, one is orange, one is magenta, one is light purple, one is yellow, and one is dark blue. The edges are mostly black and connect nodes in a complex shape, forming multiple interconnected triangles and quadrilaterals. The central node, which is dark blue, is the most heavily connected node in the graph."
