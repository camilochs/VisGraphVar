The number of nodes and edges in the graph from the image has been determined. Here's the final answer:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 18,
    "analysis": "The graph contains 10 nodes with various colors, including green, red, purple, and teal, and 18 edges that are all black, connecting the nodes. The graph's appearance is complex, suggesting it is an undirected graph."
}
```
