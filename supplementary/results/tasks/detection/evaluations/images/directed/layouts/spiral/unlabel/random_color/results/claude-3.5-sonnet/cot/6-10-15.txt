Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph and present the findings in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes in various colors (purple, blue, green, dark purple, teal, pink, brown) connected by 14 black edges. One brown node is isolated from the rest. The graph appears to be a directed network with arrows indicating edge directions."
}
