Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image:

1. Identifying the nodes:
   - There are 10 distinct nodes in the graph.
   - The nodes are colored differently: green, blue, purple, pink, and beige.
   - Each node is labeled with a number from 0 to 9.

2. Identifying the edges:
   - There are 12 edges connecting the nodes.
   - All edges are black lines.

3. Summarizing the findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 12

4. Formatting the answer in JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 12,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes in various colors (green, blue, purple, pink, and beige) connected by 12 black edges. The nodes are labeled with numbers 0-9. The graph has a central cluster with some outlying nodes connected by single edges."
}
