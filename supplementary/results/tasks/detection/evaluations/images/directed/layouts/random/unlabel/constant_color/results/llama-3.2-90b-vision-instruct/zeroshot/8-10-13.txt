**Step 1: Describe the number and colors of nodes:**

There are nine nodes present in this graph. They are all colored white, with black arrows connecting them to one another.

**Step 2: Describe the number and colors of edges:**

There are 11 edges present in this graph. They are all colored black and varying in length, connecting nodes to one another in both directions in some instances.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of nodes and edges:**

Nine white nodes are present from our analysis in step 1. There are 11 edges from our analysis in step 2, which will be reported. 

**Answer:**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 11,
    "analysis": "This graph consists of nine white nodes, each varying in the number of black arrows they are connected to, depicting a directed graph."
}
```

This is achieved by either making an exact count of all nodes and edges presented in the image or coding a script using libraries such as scikit-learn, matplotlib, or numpy that can detect edges and nodes using given coordinates and vertex positions.
