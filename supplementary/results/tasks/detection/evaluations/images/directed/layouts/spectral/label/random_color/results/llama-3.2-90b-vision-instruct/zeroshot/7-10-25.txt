I'm not seeing an image. You'll need to provide one so I can analyze and provide a proper count of nodes and edges. 

A typical analysis of a graph could be:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 9,
   "analysis": "Graph consists of 9 nodes, each marked by a different color. Nodes have a mix of small to large sizes, with black edges (arrows) connecting them from the center to the outer ends."
}
```

Please provide the image for a more accurate count or let me know if you have questions to assist in your counting.
