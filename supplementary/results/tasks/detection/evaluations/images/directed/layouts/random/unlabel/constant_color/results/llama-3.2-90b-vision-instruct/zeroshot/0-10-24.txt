Referencing the connectograph you provided, there are 10 nodes or vertices and 21 connections or edges. Above, I have broken down the edge counts in each degree. 

The graph is drawn on a white background. The vertices appear as circles and are in a black outline with no fill. The edges are effectively simple lines (no sectioning, for instance), in black matching the vertices' outline. 

Here is the count and analysis of the graph in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 21,
   "analysis": "The graph features 10 nodes or vertices and 21 connections or edges, all displayed on a white background. The vertices appear as circles in a black outline with no fill, while the edges are simple lines in black matching the vertices' outline."
}
