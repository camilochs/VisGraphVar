Following the steps you provided, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes connected by 16 black edges. The nodes are arranged in a somewhat triangular shape, with more nodes clustered at the bottom and fewer towards the top. The edges connect various nodes in a complex pattern, creating a network-like structure."
}
```

This analysis is based on careful counting of the distinct circular nodes and the lines connecting them in the image. The graph is presented in black and white, with white circular nodes and black lines representing the edges.
