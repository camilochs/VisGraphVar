Each node is colored differently including light green, lime green, dark blue, brown, blue-violet, dark green, grey, maroon, cyan, and yellow. The edges represent directed connections between nodes. For example, there is an edge directed from node 2 to node 1, node 2 to node 3 and so on. Edges are represented by black arrows. Node 2 has a directed edge towardsÂ node 1.  There are 24 directed edges in total, connecting the nodes in a non-uniform pattern."
