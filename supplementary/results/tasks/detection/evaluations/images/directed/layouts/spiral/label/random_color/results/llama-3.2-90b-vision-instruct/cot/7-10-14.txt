Based on the provided image of the graph, here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nodes and edges:

1. Identify the nodes:

   * Look for distinct points or circles in the graph.
   * Count each unique node you see.
   * Note the color of the nodes.

   There are 8 nodes in this graph. The nodes are colored as follows: black, yellow, green, blue, purple, teal, grey, and a lighter shade of green.

2. Identify the edges:

   * Look for lines connecting the nodes.
   * Count each unique edge you see.
   * Note the color of the edges.

   The edges are all black, and there are 10 edges in total.

3. Summarize your findings:

   * Report the total number of nodes.
   * Report the total number of edges.
   * Briefly describe the graph's appearance.

   The graph has 8 nodes and 10 edges. The nodes are colored black, yellow, green, blue, purple, teal, grey, and light green, while the edges are all black.
