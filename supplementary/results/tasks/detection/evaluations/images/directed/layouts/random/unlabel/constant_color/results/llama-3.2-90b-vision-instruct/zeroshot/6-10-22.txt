**Step 1) Count the Number of Nodes**

The image includes a graph with 9 nodes. Nodes are displayed with circles, and their relationships are presented as arrows between each circle. In the graph, there are 9 such circles, which are identified according to the following coordinates:

*   (300,150)
*   (500, 50)
*   (500, 450)
*   (300,550)
*   (100,550)
*   (100, 400)
*   (300, 100)
*   (400, 400)
*   (550, 550)

**Step 2) Count the Number of Edges**

Each line between the nodes represents a graph edge. Upon inspection, there are 16 such edges in the image.

**Step 3) Use Diamonds to Determine Node and Edge Colors**

Applying the diamonds for visual attributes technique:

*   All nodes appear as black circles.
*   No colors are present for any graph node.
*   All edges appear as arrows presented in black, with no colors used for any graph edge.

**Conclusion**

Overall, the image includes a directed graph with nine nodes and 16 black edges. Therefore, your answer consisting of node and edge counts, as well as a description of node and edge colors, would be:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "The provided graph includes 9 nodes and 16 edges. All nodes are displayed as black circles, and all edges are represented as black arrows. No colors are used for any nodes or edges in the graph."
}
