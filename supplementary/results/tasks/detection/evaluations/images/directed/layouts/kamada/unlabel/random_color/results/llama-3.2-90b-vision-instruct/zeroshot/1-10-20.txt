**Step 1:** Identify the data in the image. 

The graph in the image contains nodes labeled in the following colors:

 Purple
 Blue
 Yellow
 Aqua
 Navy 
 Brown

The nodes are not explicitly named. The connections between the nodes (edges) are all black.

**Step 2:** Enumerate the number of nodes.

There are eight nodes in the graph.

**Step 3:** Enumerate the number of edges. 

There are ten edges in the graph. This can be done by manually counting the edges between the nodes.

**Step 4:** Summarize the findings in the requested format: 

```json
 {
     "total_nodes": 8,
     "total_edges": 10,
     "analysis": "The graph contains eight unlabelled nodes in the colors purple, blue, yellow, aqua, navy, and brown. There are ten edges between the nodes, and they are presented in black." 
}
```
