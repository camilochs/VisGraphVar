### Step 1: Identifying Nodes

*   Upon examining the graph, we observe **10** distinct points or circles.
*   The nodes are colored as follows: purple (2), blue (3), green (2), yellow (1), pink (1). The shading of the filled-in center area ranges in hue from dark to light (dark: blue, purple, pink, green, light: pink, green, yellow, blue).

### Step 2: Identifying Edges

*   Next, we observe **17** lines connecting the nodes. 
*   Each edge of the graph is of the same black color.

### Step 3: Summarizing Our Findings

*   The total number of nodes is **10**.
*   The total number of edges is **17**.

### Final Answer 

The graph is formed through circles colored in various hues, connected by **solid black lines**.
