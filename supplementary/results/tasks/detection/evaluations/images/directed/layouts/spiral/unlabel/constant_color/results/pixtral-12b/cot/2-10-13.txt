Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

### Step 1: Identify the Nodes
- The graph contains distinct points or circles.
- Count each unique node:
  - The graph has nodes at the following positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
  - Total number of nodes: 10

### Step 2: Identify the Edges
- The graph contains lines connecting these nodes.
- Count each unique edge:
  - There are edges connecting:
    - Node 1 to Node 2
    - Node 5 to Node 6
    - Node 1 to Node 5
    - Node 1 to Node 9
    - Node 2 to Node 6
    - Node 3 to Node 8
    - Node 4 to Node 7
    - Node 4 to Node 9
    - Node 5 to Node 9
    - Node 6 to Node 7
    - Node 6 to Node 10
    - Node 7 to Node 9
    - Node 9 to Node 10
    - Node 10 to Node 8
  - Total number of edges: 14

### Step 3: Summarize Findings
- The graph has 10 nodes.
- The graph has 14 edges.
- The nodes and edges are all black in color, forming a densely connected network.

### Step 4: Format the Answer
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 10 nodes and 14 edges. The nodes and edges are black, forming a densely connected network."
}
```
