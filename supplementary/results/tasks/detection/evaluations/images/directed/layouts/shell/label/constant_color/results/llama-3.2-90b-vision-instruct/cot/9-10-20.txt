**Analysis of the Graph**

**Step 1: Identify the Nodes**

Upon examining the graph, 10 distinct nodes are visible. Each node is represented by a numbered circle. The nodes are white with black numbers.

**Step 2: Identify the Edges**

The graph contains 17 lines connecting the nodes. Each line represents an edge in the graph. All the edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize Findings**

In total, there are **10 nodes** and **17 edges** in the graph. 

**Step 4: Format Answer**

The analysis in JSON format is presented as follows:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 17,
  "analysis": "A white graph with 10 nodes and 17 edges, featuring white nodes with black numbers and black edges."
}
