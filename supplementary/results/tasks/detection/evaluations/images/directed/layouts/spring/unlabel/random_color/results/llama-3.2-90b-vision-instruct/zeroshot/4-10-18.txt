**Analysis of the Graph**

Since no image has been provided, it is impossible to give any specific numbers of nodes or edges present within the image. Without the graph's visual representation, we cannot accurately count the nodes and edges.

**Assumption of Graph Schema**

However, for the sake of example, let's assume that a simple graph consists of 7 nodes (represented by circles of different colors: Navy blue, brown, green, yellow, violet, pink, and light green) that are labeled, and suppose there are 9 edges. The edges are represented by lines joining the nodes with various colors. It is crucial to note that the number of nodes or edges could be different based on the actual image.

**JSON Format Representation**

For this example the JSON response could be:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 7,
    "total_edges": 9,
    "analysis": "The graph has various colored nodes: Navy blue, brown, green, yellow, violet, pink and light green. It has 9 edges connecting the nodes"
}
```
