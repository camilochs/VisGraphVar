The image displays a standard directed graph. Based on Step 1, I count 10 unique nodes that reference previous or unique networked graphs. The nodes are all the same color and the same size. 

In accordance with Step 2, there are 18 unique edges. Each node is connected to at least one other edge, but there are several instances of higher connectivity.  The edges are below average size. 

Here is the required JSON format output:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 18,
  "analysis": "The graph displays 10 nodes all connected to each other by 18 edges with a color scheme that is plain and is a standard representation of a network graph." 
}
```
