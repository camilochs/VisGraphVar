In this image, there are distinct points or circles with numbers inside denoting nodes. The graph consists of 10 nodes, each represented by a black circle with a unique integer inside (0-9). 

The graph also contains lines connecting the nodes, representing edges. By counting each unique edge between the nodes in the image, we conclude that the graph contains 16 edges, each represented by a black line.

The entire graph is black, increasing visibility against the white background. 

The following JSON data summarizes the graph:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 16,
  "analysis": "Black nodes and edges on a white background, with black nodes labeled with consecutive integers starting from 0, and black lines (edges) connecting them."
}
