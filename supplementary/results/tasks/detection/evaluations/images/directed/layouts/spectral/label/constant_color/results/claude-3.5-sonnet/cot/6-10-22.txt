Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph and present the findings in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes represented by white circles with black outlines, each labeled with a number from 0 to 9. The nodes are connected by 17 black edges forming a complex network structure. The graph has a triangular shape overall, with node 4 at the bottom left, node 1 at the bottom right, and node 9 at the top forming the main triangle. The remaining nodes are clustered more densely in the upper part of the graph."
}
