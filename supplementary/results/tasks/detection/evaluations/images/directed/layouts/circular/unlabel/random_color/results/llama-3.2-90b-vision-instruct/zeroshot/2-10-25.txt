**Step 1: Identify the nodes in the image**

There are nine nodes in the image, each with an individual color. Each node depicts the graph's starting point for a particular color. Each point represents a specific origin point in the graph.

**Step 2: Identify the edges associated with each node**

Each node is connected to other nodes through distinct edges. Counting these edges and their connections to other nodes gives the following list: 

| **Node** | **Number of Edges** |
| :-------- | :----------------- |
| Blue      | 4                  |
| Green     | 3                  |
| Red       | 3                  |
| Light Red | 2                  |
| Light Brown | 3                  |
| Purple    | 2                  |
| Turquoise | 2                  |
| Cyan      | 3                  |
| Dark Brown | 3                  |

**Calculating the Total Number of Edges**

Right now, in our graph count, we have 27 edges counted. This is not true because we need to divide the count of vertices by 2 to provide accurate information that will generate the correct information about the graph.

**Calculating the Correct Number of Edges**

To get an accurate and correct answer, we divide the number 27 by 2. This gives the correct number of edges for the total number of edges.

**Step 3: Calculate and present all data in JSON format**\
At the very end, one must combine all the original answers into a JSON format, which, in this example, includes all the information one needs to quantify the total number of nodes and total source count information in the graph.

**Final Answer:**


```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 13,
    "analysis": "The nodes in this graph each have a specific color: blue, green, red, brown, light red, purple, turqoise, cyan and dark brown. The edges are black; they reconnect to the nodes of a different color or the same color. In total, the graph, which uses 9 nodes and 13 edges to make the graph more easy to see, provides a take-home dot graph image and a well-written submitted json output, when provided correctly."
