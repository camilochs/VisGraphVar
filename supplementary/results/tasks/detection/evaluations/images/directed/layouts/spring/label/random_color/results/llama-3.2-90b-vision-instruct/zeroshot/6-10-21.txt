The graph in the image shows an eccentric simple graph, where the nodes are a variety of colors and the edges are black and do not contain loops or multiple edges between two nodes. There are 9 nodes and 16 edges present. 

The final answer is the following JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "The graph is an eccentric simple graph with 9 nodes of different colors and 16 black edges. There are no loops or multiple edges between two nodes present in the graph."
}
