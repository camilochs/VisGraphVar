**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

In this image, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

These edges can be determined by following the connected lines. 

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

There are 10 nodes and 13 edges. The nodes are depicted as white circles with the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 on them. All the edges are black lines.

**Step 4: Present the answer in JSON format**

                    ```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 13,
  "analysis": "The graph has 10 white nodes numbered from 0 to 9 and 13 black lines that connect these nodes in a network-style graph."
}
```
