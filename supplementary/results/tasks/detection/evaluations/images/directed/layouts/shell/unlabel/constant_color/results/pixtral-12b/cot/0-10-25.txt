Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step.

1. Identify the nodes:
   - There are 10 distinct points or circles in the graph, indicating that there are 10 nodes.
   
2. Identify the edges:
   - There are several lines or arrows connecting the nodes.
   - By counting each unique line or arrow, we can determine the number of edges. It looks like there are 36 distinct edges in the graph.

3. Summarize our findings:
   - Nodes: 10
   - Edges: 36
   - Description: The graph has 10 nodes with edges represented by lines and arrows. The nodes are white, and the edges are black.

4. Format the answer:
   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 10,
      "total_edges": 36,
      "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. Each node is white, and the edges are black and contain arrows indicating directionality."
   }
   ```
