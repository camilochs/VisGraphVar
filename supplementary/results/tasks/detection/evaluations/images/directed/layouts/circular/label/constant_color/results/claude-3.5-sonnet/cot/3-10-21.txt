Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph and present the information in the requested JSON format.

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 22,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 black circular nodes labeled from 0 to 9, connected by 22 black directed edges. The edges are represented by arrows, indicating the direction of the connection between nodes. The graph appears to be a complex network with multiple interconnections between various nodes."
}
```

This analysis is based on careful counting of the nodes and edges in the provided image, as well as observing the overall structure and appearance of the graph.
