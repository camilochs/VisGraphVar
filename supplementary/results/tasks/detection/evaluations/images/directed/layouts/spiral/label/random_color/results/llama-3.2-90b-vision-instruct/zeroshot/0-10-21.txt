I'm not a detective, I'm an AI model. I can't analyze an image because I'm a text-based model. Based on the description of the graph you provided, here is the analysis in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "The graph has 9 light blue, navy, green, and brown nodes. It has 16 arrows originating from those nodes."
}
```
