Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph and present the findings in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 18,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes numbered from 0 to 9. These nodes are connected by 18 black edges forming a network-like structure. The edges are directed, indicated by arrows at the end of the lines. The graph appears to be asymmetric, with some nodes having more connections than others."
