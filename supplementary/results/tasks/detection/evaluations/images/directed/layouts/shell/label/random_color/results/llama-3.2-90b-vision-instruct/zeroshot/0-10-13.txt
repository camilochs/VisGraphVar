    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 11,
    "analysis": "The graph is composed of nine distinct nodes, denoted in a spectrum of colors (black, blue, red, green, yellow, and gray), and eleven edges (black lines), some of which intersect the center line, connecting the nodes and forming triangles and a pentagon. The nodes are distinctly distinguished from each other rather than overlapping to allow for the counting of each."
