To analyze the graph in the image step by step, we will follow the provided steps:

1. **Identify the nodes**: 
   - The graph contains distinct points or circles.
   - There are 10 unique nodes visible.
   - All nodes appear to be white.

2. **Identify the edges**:
   - Lines connect the nodes to each other.
   - There are 16 unique edges visible.
   - All edges appear to be black.

3. **Summarize findings**:
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 16
   - The graph's appearance is a network of 10 white nodes connected by 16 black edges.

4. **Format the answer**:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 16,
  "analysis": "The graph is a network of 10 white nodes connected by 16 black edges."
}
```
