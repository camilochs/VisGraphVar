**Analysis of the Graph**

To analyze the graph in the image, we will follow the steps outlined:

**Step 1: Identify the Nodes**

*   The graph contains distinct points or circles that represent the nodes.
*   There are 10 unique nodes in the graph.
*   All the nodes are white.

**Step 2: Identify the Edges**

*   The lines connecting the nodes represent the edges.
*   There are 18 unique edges in the graph.
*   All the edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize Findings**

In summary, the graph consists of:

*   10 nodes
*   18 edges
*   White nodes
*   Black edges

The graph also maintains the same overall design when printed in black and white or color.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 18,
    "analysis": "The graph has 10 white nodes connected by 18 black edges."
}
