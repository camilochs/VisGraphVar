**Solution Steps:**

1. Count the nodes: Nodes are represented by circles in the graph. The number of nodes is 10.

2. Count the edges: Edges are lines connecting the nodes. There are 17 lines connecting the nodes.

3. Observe colors: The nodes and edges in the graph provided are black.

4. Format answer: The answer is formatted as a JSON object describing the number of nodes and edges present in the graph. 

**Answer:**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 17,
    "analysis": "The graph consists of black nodes (10) connected by black edges (17)."
}
```
