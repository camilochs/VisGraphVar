An image of a graph with nodes and edges.

To identify the nodes, there are 8 distinct points drawn all the way around the outside of the graph. These nodes have a black outline and a center black mark; each one is clearly demarcated by these traits.

For the edges, we can see that there are 15 lines that connect each node to another throughout the graph. These edges are also black.

Finally, we note that the graph is drawn with black lines and dots on a white background. We can summarize:

The graph contains black nodes and edges on a white background, connected in a specific pattern.

An easy but important step follows next. Our findings should be quickly reformatatted to fit the specified format for the answer. The resulting reformatting looks like this:

**Answer:** 

{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 15,
   "analysis": "The graph is on a white background and contains 8 nodes and 15 connecting edges. The nodes and edges are both demarcated by black outlines and marks."
