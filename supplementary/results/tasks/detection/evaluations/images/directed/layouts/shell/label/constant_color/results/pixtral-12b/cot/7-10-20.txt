To analyze the graph in the image step by step, follow these steps:

### 1. Identify the Nodes:
- Look for distinct circles in the graph.
- Count each unique node you see.
- The nodes have numbers from 0 to 9.
- There are a total of 10 nodes.

### 2. Identify the Edges:
- Look for lines connecting the nodes.
- Count each unique edge you see.
- There are lines connecting the nodes in various directions.
- Specifically, each node is connected such that they form a network.
- There is a total of 24 edges.

### 3. Summarize the Findings:
- **Total nodes:** 10
- **Total edges:** 24
- **Description:**
  - The graph visually appears as a directed network.
  - Nodes connected through directed edges are present.
  - The nodes are uniquely labeled from 0 to 9.

### 4. JSON Format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 24,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9 with 24 directed edges connecting them. It forms a complex directed network."
}
```
