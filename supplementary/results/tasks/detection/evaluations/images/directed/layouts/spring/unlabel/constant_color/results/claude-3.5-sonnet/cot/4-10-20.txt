Following the steps you provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image and present the results in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes connected by 14 black directed edges. The nodes are arranged in a somewhat linear fashion, with some nodes branching off to the sides. The edges have arrowheads indicating the direction of connection between nodes."
}
```
