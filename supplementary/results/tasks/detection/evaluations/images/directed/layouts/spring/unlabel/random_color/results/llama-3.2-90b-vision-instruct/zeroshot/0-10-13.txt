**Step 1: Determine the total number of nodes.**

To determine the total number of nodes, we count the number of circles on the graph. The number of circles represents the total nodes.



**Step 2: Determine the total number of edges.** 

To determine the total number of edges, we count the number of arrows connecting each node.



**Step 3: Describe the colors.**

Using the information, we determine the number of node and edge colors presented.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   "total_nodes":9, 
   "total_edges":9, 
   "analysis": "our graph has 9 nodes and 9 edges. The nodes are colored green, brown, blue, purple, magenta, teal, lilac, and two light blues. The edges are all black."
