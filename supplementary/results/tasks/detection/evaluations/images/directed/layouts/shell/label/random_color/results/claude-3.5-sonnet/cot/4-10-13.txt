Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph and present the results in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 15,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 8 colored nodes (purple, pink, light pink, green, yellow, and brown) connected by 15 black directed edges. The nodes are arranged in a somewhat circular pattern, with edges creating a complex network of connections between them."
}
