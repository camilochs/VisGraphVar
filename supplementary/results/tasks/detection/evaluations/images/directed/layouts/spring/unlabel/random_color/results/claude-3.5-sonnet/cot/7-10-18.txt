Following the steps you've outlined, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes in various colors (green, purple, teal, red, brown, light green, mint green, blue, orange, and yellow). The nodes are connected by 13 black directed edges, forming a network-like structure with one node (yellow) positioned farther away from the main cluster."
