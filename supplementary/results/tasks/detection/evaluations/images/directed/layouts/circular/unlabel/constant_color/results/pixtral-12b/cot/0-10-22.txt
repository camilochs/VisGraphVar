Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. Identify the nodes:
   - The graph has multiple distinct points or circles.
   - Count each unique node you see.
   - There are 12 nodes present in the graph.

2. Identify the edges:
   - The graph has lines connecting these nodes.
   - Each line indicates an edge.
   - There are 24 edges connecting the nodes through directed lines.

3. Summarize your findings:
   - The graph has a more complex structure with nodes arranged in a polygon manner.
   - Each node has multiple connections indicating a directed graph.
   - The edges are uniformly directed and connected to multiple nodes suggesting a higher connectivity structure.

4. Format your answer:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 12,
   "total_edges": 24,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 12 nodes arranged in a polygon manner and 24 directed edges connecting them uniformly.
                Nodes are white, and edges are black with directed arrows showing connection paths."
}
