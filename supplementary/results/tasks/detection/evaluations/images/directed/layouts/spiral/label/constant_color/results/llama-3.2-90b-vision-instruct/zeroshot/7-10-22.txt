**Step 1: Count the number of nodes in the graph.**

There are 9 nodes in the graph, numbered from 0 to 9.

**Step 2: Count the number of edges in the graph.**

There are 16 edges in the graph, connecting different nodes.

**Step 3: Analyze the graph and describe it in brief.**

The graph is a directed graph with 9 nodes and 16 edges. All nodes are represented by white circles with black numbers, and all edges are represented by black lines. The edges are directed, indicating the direction of connection between nodes.

**Answer:** 

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "Directed graph with 9 nodes and 16 edges. All nodes are white circles with black numbers, and all edges are black lines."
}
