**Step One: Count and Note Down the Number of Nodes Available**

*   Numerous circles (or nodes) are present on the image, likely connecting one another.



**Conclusion to Step One:** 

*   **Total Number of Nodes on Image: Nine (9)**

**Step Two: Count and Note Down the number of Edges Available**

*   Various arrows, extending outward from the nodes, scatter the image. 
*   In this illustration, the edges are black lines. 



**Conclusion to Step Two:** 

*   **Total Number of Edges on the Image: Nine (9)**



**Final Answer:**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 9,
    "analysis": "The graph features black edges with black node boundaries containing a white inner border on a white background."
}
