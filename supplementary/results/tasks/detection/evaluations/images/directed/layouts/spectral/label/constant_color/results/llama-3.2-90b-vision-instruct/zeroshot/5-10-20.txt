I'm unable to count and report the number of nodes and edges in the image as I'm a text-based model and do not have the capability to visually analyze images. However, I can provide a brief description of the graph based on the JSON structure you provided:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 0,
   "total_edges": 0,
   "analysis": "No image provided for analysis. Please provide an image to count the nodes and edges."
}
```
