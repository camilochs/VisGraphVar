As per your request, I analyzed the diagram and discovered the following:

The indices range from 0 to 9, for a total of 10 nodes.

Counting each line joining the nodes, there are 20 edges connecting the nodes.

The nodes are consistently colored in white, while the edges are consistently colored in black. They show an "edge weight" with pulsing black lighting bolts, pointing at the receiving node end, indicating a double-edge.

Here is your answer in the JSON format you requested:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 20,
    "analysis": "The graph contains 10 nodes consistently depicted in white and 20 edges consistently depicted in black with pulsing black lightning bolts at the edge ends pointing at the receiving nodes. The colored edges and weighting on the diagram's edges suggest they are directed edges. The table indexes show 10 nodes of directed edges between 0 and 9."
}
