I'm not able to analyze the image as you wish, but here's an example of how the answer would appear in JSON format given a different image. 

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 17,
    "analysis": "This appears to be a connected graph using fully directed graph format. All of the nodes and edges appear to be black in color". 
}
```

This answer would only be correct if the presented image was the actual graph provided.
