According to the provided instructions and accompanying image, we will identify the number of nodes and edges present in the graph.

The graph depicts nine distinct nodes, each represented by a differently colored circle. The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Connecting the various nodes are ten unique lines, or edges, of which all are black in color.

In conclusion, the graph contains nine nodes and ten edges where the color of the nodes vary, but all edges are black. 

Below are the results of our analysis in JSON format: 
```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 10,
  "analysis": "The graph consists of nine distinct nodes numbered 1-9. Each node corresponds with a differently colored circle. The nine nodes are all interconnected by ten black lines, which are referred to as edges."
