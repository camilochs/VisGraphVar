**Graph Analysis**

The graph in the image is a directed graph, meaning it has edges with directions.

**Node Count**
There are 10 nodes in the graph, each represented by a circle with a number inside.

**Edge Count**
To count the edges, we can start from any node and follow the arrows to other nodes. Each arrow represents one edge. After carefully counting them, there are 16 edges in total.

**Colors**
Both the nodes and edges are black, indicating that the graph does not utilize color for differentiation or highlighting specific connections.

**Conclusion**
In summary, the graph consists of 10 nodes and 16 edges, with all elements presented in black.
