**Analysis of the Graph**

**Step 1: Identify the Nodes**

*   We can see distinct points or circles in the graph.
*   Each node is counted as unique.
*   All nodes are white.

**Step 2: Identify the Edges**

*   Lines connect the nodes, representing edges.
*   Each unique edge is counted.
*   The edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize Findings**

*   **Total Nodes:** 10
*   **Total Edges:** 14
*   The graph is a collection of connected nodes with black edges on a white background.

**Final Answer**

```json
