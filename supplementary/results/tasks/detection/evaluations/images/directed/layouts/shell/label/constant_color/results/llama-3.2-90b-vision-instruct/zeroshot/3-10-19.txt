**Analyzing the Graph**

To determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph, we will carefully examine the image.

* **Node Count:** Each node is represented by a numbered circle. By counting these circles, we can find the total number of nodes.
* **Edge Count:** Edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes. We will count each line to find the total number of edges.

**Counting Nodes:**

* We observe 10 numbered circles, indicating 10 nodes.

**Counting Edges:**

* There are 15 lines connecting the nodes, indicating 15 edges.

**Color Analysis:**

* All nodes and edges appear to be black, as there is no visible color variation.

**Conclusion:**

Based on our analysis, the graph contains 10 nodes and 15 edges. The color scheme is consistent, with all elements appearing in black.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 15,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 black nodes and 15 black edges, forming a connected network."
}
