The image depicts a non-directed graph, a type of graph where edges do not have an inherent direction. 

The tree has nine nodes and is characterized by the absence of self-loops or multiple edges.

The distance from one node to another is calculated as the number of hops, or lines, between the two nodes.

Therefore, the graph can be represented in JavaScript Object Notation as follows:

{
	"total_nodes": 9,
	"total_edges": 15,
	"analysis": "The vertices of the graph are color coded:  one medium brown, one dark brown, one emerlad green, one dark green, two medium green, one salmon, one teal, one blue, and one magenta. The edges are black."
