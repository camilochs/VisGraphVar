Based on the image, here is the analysis:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 18,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 distinct points in different colors (red, blue, green, purple, pale blue, and yellow) that are connected by 18 black lines (edges) thus making it a colour graph graph (color graph shows that there is a relationship between vertices). The graph is complex with multiple connections between nodes. The flow represented by the edges of these points is in a circular manner."
