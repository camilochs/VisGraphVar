Let's analyze the graph step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - The graph contains:
     - Nodes labeled: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - The edges are lines connecting the nodes, such as:
     - 0 connected to 6
     - 1 connected to 4, 5, and 6
     - 2 connected to 1, 4, and 5
     - 3 connected to 1
     - 6 connected to 1, 7, and 9
     - 7 connected to 3 and 9
     - 9 connected to 6 and 7

3. **Summarize findings:**
   - Total nodes: 10
   - Total edges: 13
   - The graph includes a primary cluster of nodes with numerous interconnections, and a smaller isolated cluster consisting of nodes 0 and 6.

4. **Format the Answer:**
   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 10,
      "total_edges": 13,
      "analysis": "The graph contains 10 nodes labeled 0 through 9 and 13 edges. The nodes and edges are displayed in black. The graph has one small isolated cluster of nodes (0 and 6) and a larger cluster with several interconnected nodes."
   }
