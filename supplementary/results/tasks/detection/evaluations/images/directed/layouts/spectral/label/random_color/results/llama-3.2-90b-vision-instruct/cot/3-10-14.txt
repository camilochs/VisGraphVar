**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   The graph contains distinct points or circles, each representing a node.
*   Counting each unique node, there are 9 nodes in total.
*   The nodes are colored as follows:
    *   3 nodes are dark blue
    *   1 node is light blue
    *   1 node is purple
    *   1 node is yellow
    *   1 node is teal
    *   2 nodes are green

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   Lines connecting the nodes indicate edges.
*   Edge colors are indistinguishable, so only the total number of edges can be identified. There are 8 edges in total.

**Step 3: Summarize findings**

*   The graph features 9 nodes, with 3 nodes being dark blue, 1 light blue, 1 purple, 1 yellow, 1 teal, and 2 green.
*   There are 8 edges connecting these nodes.

**Step 4: Format answer**

*   The graph contains 9 nodes and 8 edges. The nodes vary in color but the edges appear black and non-distinguishable.
