The graph in the image contains 10 nodes and 15 edges. To determine these values, I counted the distinct circles representing the nodes, and then tallied the individual lines connecting these nodes, which represent the edges. The nodes and edges are both black in color against a white background. The final answer is:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 15,
  "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes and 15 edges. The nodes and edges are both black in color, presented against a white background."
}
```
