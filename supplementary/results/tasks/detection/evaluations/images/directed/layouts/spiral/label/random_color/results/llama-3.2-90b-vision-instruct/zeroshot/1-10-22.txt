I'm not able to analyze the image as I'm a text-based AI and do not have the capability to access or process images. However, I can guide you on how to identify the following elements from the graph:
1.  Node - Each vertex or endpoint of the line/edge in an undirected graph serves as a node.
2.  Edge - Each closed line connecting 2 nodes in an undirected graph constitutes an edge.



To count the number of nodes and edges in the graph, you must manually tag each node and edge and keep a track of the count.



Here's a sample output in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 15,
    "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes represented in different colors and connected by 15 edges drawn in black"
}
```
