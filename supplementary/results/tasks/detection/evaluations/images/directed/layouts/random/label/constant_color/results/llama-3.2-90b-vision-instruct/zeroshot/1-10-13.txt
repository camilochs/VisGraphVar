I'm not able to see the image of the graph you've mentioned. However, based on the general request you've provided, I can give you an example of how one might analyze a graph and provide the answer in the specified JSON format.

Assuming we have a graph with visible nodes and edges (which you did not provide), the analysis could look something like this:

*   The graph has 9 total nodes.
*   There are 12 total edges present.

Below is a sample response in the JSON format you've specified.

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 12,
    "analysis": "A directed graph with 9 nodes and 12 edges. Each node has a distinct number (0-8) and the edges are represented by arrows connecting the nodes. The nodes are colored in white and the edges are in black."
}
```

Please note that this is just an example, and a proper analysis would depend on the actual content and context of the image you've described, which is not visible to me.

If I had access to the image, I'd be able to give a more specific and accurate analysis.
