I've analyzed the graph in the image according to the steps you provided. Here's the summary in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 22,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes connected by 22 black edges. The nodes are arranged in a somewhat triangular shape, with some nodes forming a rough pentagon at the top and others extending downward. The edges connect various nodes throughout the graph, creating a complex network structure."
