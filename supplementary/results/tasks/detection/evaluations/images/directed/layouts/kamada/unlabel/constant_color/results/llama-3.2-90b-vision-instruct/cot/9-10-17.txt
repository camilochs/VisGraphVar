The graph comprises 10 distinct nodes, each depicted as a circle. The nodes are without coloration, distinguished solely by their shape and position within the coordinate plane.

The interconnections encompass a total of 16 edges. Like the nodes, edges are uncolored, characterized by their linear structure and the nodes they link.

The graph exhibits a intricately webbed configuration, without a discernible central node and balanced throughout its hull. The generally smooth curved directions of all edges suggest no sharp changes in visual direction.
