**Step 1**: Identify the nodes

Upon examining the image, we can see that the nodes are represented by numbers in circles (0-9). There are nine distinct numbers.


**Step 2**: Identify the edges

The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.


**Step 3**: Count the total nodes

There are nine nodes in the image.


**Step 4**: Count the total edges

There are 10 edges (which is 19 connections between two nodes) in the image.


**Step 5**: Observe and write down the node and edge colors

The nodes can be visualized as black numbers in the image, and the edges are black.

**Step 6:** Write the final equation

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 19,
    "analysis": "Graph contains 9 black nodes and 19 black edges."
}
```
