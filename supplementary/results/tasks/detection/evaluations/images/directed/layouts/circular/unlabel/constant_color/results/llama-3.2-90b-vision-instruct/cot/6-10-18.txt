**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

- The graph contains 10 distinct points or circles.
- All nodes are white.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

- The graph has 14 lines connecting the nodes.
- All edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize findings**

- Total nodes: 10
- Total edges: 14
- The graph consists of white nodes connected by black edges, forming a complex network structure.

**Step 4: Format answer in JSON**

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 14,
  "analysis": "A network consisting of 10 white nodes connected by 14 black edges."
}
