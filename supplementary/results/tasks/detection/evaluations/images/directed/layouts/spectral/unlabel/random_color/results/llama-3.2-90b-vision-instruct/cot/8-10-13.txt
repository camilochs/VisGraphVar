Sure I can help with that, here is the analysis of the image in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 8,
  "total_edges": 10,
  "analysis": "The graph contains 8 circular nodes that are colored blue, green, violet, gray, cyan, and red. The graph also contains10 edges that are black. The graph is spread along multiple directions."
}
```
