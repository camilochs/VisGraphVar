**Explanation and Calculation**

To analyze the graph, we will:

1. Count the number of nodes (circles) in the image.
2. Count the number of edges (lines connecting nodes) in the image.
3. Identify the colors used for nodes and edges.

**Node Counting**

Upon examining the image, we can see that there are 10 nodes (circles) labeled with numbers from 0 to 9.

**Edge Counting**

We observe that each node is connected to multiple neighboring nodes through lines (edges). By carefully counting these connections, we find that there are a total of 20 directed edges in the graph.

**Analysis and Colors**

The nodes are represented by circles, with all nodes being the same color. The edges are also uniform in color, as they are all printed in black ink.

**Answer**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 20,
   "analysis": "The image contains 10 black nodes and 20 directed edges also in black ink."
}
```
