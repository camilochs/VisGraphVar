The image depicts a graph with ten nodes and sixteen edges. The graph comprises five different colored nodes:

* 4 green;
* 3 pink;
* 2 brown;
* and 1 light gray;

All edges are black and all edges are interconnected. Notably, the graph does not contain any isolated nodes, and it is fully interconnected. Since the graph has 10 nodes and is fully interconnected, we can calculate the total number of edges with the following equation: 

$\frac{(n * (n -1)}{2} = \frac{10 * (10 -1)}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45$


This computation confirms our initial count is of 16 edges is inaccurate with only a 36% accuracy. Based on this analysis, it is possible that our initial count of 16 edges may have oversimplified the count as many of the visual edges may not have physically connected nodes.
