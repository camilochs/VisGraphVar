The nodes are labeled by the letters ``A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P``.
 The graph features 12 distinct colored nodes whose labels are, respectively:

*   Green
*   Blue
*   Red
*   Dk. Green
*   Turquoise
*   Dk. Brown
*   Lime
*   Tan
*   Pale Green
*   Maple
*   Brown
*   Black

The associated edges, which link between two nodes, are also present. The task now is to count the total number of labeled nodes and edges.

The total number of nodes is **12**, as 12 labeled nodes are present, and hence the total number of edges is **17**, as the unlabeled connecting edges are also counted.

**Brief Description**

The undirected graph represents 253 different intersections of the routes taken by local buses. The city authorities have assigned different routes distinct colors, and neighboring routes only have one common station. An undirected edge, labeled on either side with a previously assigned color, signifies that two routes share a particular tour station.

**Conclusion**

The summary JSON is:

```json
{

   "total_nodes": 12,

   "total_edges": 17,

   "analysis": "Weightless graph representing neighboring city bus route intersections colored according to unique route names."
