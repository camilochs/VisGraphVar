**Step 1: Identify the nodes:**

Look for distinct points or circles in the graph. Count each unique node you see.
Identify the color of the nodes.
In the image, there are 9 circles that represent the nodes. The nodes are all black.

**Step 2: Identify the edges:**

Look for lines connecting the nodes. Count each unique edge you see.
Identify the color of the edges.
In the image, there are 13 lines that connect the nodes together. The edges are all black.

**Step 3: Summarize your findings:**

Report the total number of nodes. 
Report the total number of edges. 
Briefly describe the graph's appearance.
The graph contains 9 nodes and 13 edges. 

**Step 4: Format your answer:**

Here is your analysis in the required JSON format:

```
{
"total_nodes": 9,
"total_edges": 13,
"analysis": "The graph is represented by 9 black nodes and 13 black edges."
}
```
This concludes the step-by-step analysis of the graph in the image to determine the number of nodes and edges.
