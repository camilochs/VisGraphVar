**Step 1: Identify the nodes in the graph.**

The nodes are represented by the colored circles in the image.

**Step 2: Count the number of nodes.**

There are 10 nodes in total.

**Step 3: Identify the edges in the graph.**

The edges are represented by the lines connecting the nodes.

**Step 4: Count the number of edges.**

There are 18 edges in total.

**Step 5: Analyze the graph for a brief description, including node and edge colors.**

The graph consists of 10 nodes with alternating colors (red, green, blue, and purple) and 18 edges. All edges are black.

**Conclusion:**

*   10 nodes
*   18 edges
*   The network shown contains 10 differently colored nodes with 18 black edges running between nodes.Â
