The number of nodes and edges present in the graph can be calculated as follows:

*   The image features nine numbered circles, ranging from 0 to 9, with arrows connecting these nodes. The nodes are evenly distributed throughout the image and have thick black outlines.
*   The edges, or arrows, in the image are also black and have distinct line widths.

By applying the definitions, the number of nodes and edges can be counted as:

*   Nodes: reduce((0,1 ... 9), (a, b) -> a + b) = 45
*   Edges: Each arrow represents an edge. By extending the rule for counting edges by hand, the total number of edges is 15.

Consequently, the number of nodes and edges present in the graph is 10 and 15, respectively.

As a result, the answer in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 15,
    "analysis": "The graph displays 10 connected nodes in black, ranging from 0 to 9, against a white background. The connections between the nodes are represented by black arrows with considerable line widths."
}
