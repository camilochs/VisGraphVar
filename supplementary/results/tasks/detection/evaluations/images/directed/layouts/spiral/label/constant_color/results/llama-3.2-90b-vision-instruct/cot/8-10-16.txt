**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

The graph has 9 distinct points or circles, each representing a node. All nodes are black.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

There are 12 lines connecting the nodes, each representing an edge. All edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize findings**

*   Total number of nodes: 9
*   Total number of edges: 12
*   Brief description of the graph's appearance: The graph is a simple directed graph with 9 black nodes and 12 black edges.

**Step 4: Format answer**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 9,
    "total_edges": 12,
    "analysis": "The graph is a simple directed graph with 9 black nodes and 12 black edges."
}
