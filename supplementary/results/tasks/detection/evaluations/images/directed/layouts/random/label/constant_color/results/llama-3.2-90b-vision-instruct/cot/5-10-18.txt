To analyze the graph in the image, I will follow the steps provided:

1. **Identify the nodes**: The graph contains distinct points or circles that are numbered from 0 to 9. There are a total of 10 nodes. All nodes appear to be white circles with black numbers inside them.

2. **Identify the edges**: The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes. By carefully counting each unique edge, I find that there are numerous lines connecting different pairs of nodes. After a thorough count, there are 15 edges. All edges are black.

3. **Summarize findings**: 
   - Total nodes: 10
   - Total edges: 15
   - The graph's appearance suggests a directed graph because each edge has an arrowhead indicating the direction of the connection between nodes. The background of the graph is white.

**Final Answer**:
```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 15,
  "analysis": "This is a directed graph with white nodes and black edges set against a white background."
}
```
