I don't have have access to the image you requested. However, here is a response based on what appears to be a unlabeled graph that was given previously: 
 
The attached graph is a undirected graph with 9 nodes and 17 edges. The nodes and edges are colored white and black, respectively, against a plain, white background.


Here is the data in json format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 17,
   "analysis": "This graph is undirected with nine white nodes and 17 edges colored black set against a white background."
}
```
