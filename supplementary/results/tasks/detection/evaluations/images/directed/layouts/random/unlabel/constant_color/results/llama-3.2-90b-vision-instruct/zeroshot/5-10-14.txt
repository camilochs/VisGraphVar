**Answer:**.

After analyzing the image, we can present the necessary information as follows:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 12,
   "analysis": "The graph comprises a directly connected collection of 9 'nodes' and 12 'edges', presented entirely in black. This specific structure appears to ensure a path of travel exists between each node and every other node, implying this is a complete strongly-connected graph."
}
```

The image shows a network with 9 nodes and 12 edges, where each node is connected to every other node. This structure makes it a complete graph. The nodes and edges are all black, indicating that there is no distinction or weighting between them based on color in this representation. The connectivity ensures that there exists a path (both direct and indirect) from any node to any other node, making it strongly connected as well.
