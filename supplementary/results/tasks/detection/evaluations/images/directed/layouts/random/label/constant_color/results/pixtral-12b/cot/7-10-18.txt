Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - The graph contains distinct circles, each with a number inside them. Counting each unique node, there are 10 nodes in total.
   - Nodes observed: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - The graph contains lines connecting these nodes. Counting each unique edge, there are 20 lines connecting the nodes.
   - Edges can be visually identified as the lines connecting pairs of these nodes.

3. **Summarize your findings:**
   - The total number of nodes is 10.
   - The total number of edges is 20.
   - The nodes are black in color, and the edges are black in color. The graph has a complex structure with multiple connections between nodes, forming a directed graph.

4. **JSON format:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 20,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 10 black nodes and 20 black edges. The graph is complex and directed, with several nodes having multiple connections."
}
```
