**Step 1: Count the nodes in the graph.**

Looking at the image, there are 10 nodes present in the graph.

**Step 2: Count the edges in the graph.**

There are 20 edges present in the graph.

**Step 3: Determine the colors of the nodes and edges.**

All the nodes and edges are black.

**Step 4: Summarize the findings.**

After analysis, the total number of nodes is 10, and the total number of edges is 20. All the nodes are black, and all the edges are black.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 20,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 black nodes and 20 black edges, forming a complex network structure."
}
