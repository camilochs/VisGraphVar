Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes:
   - The graph contains circles or points, which represent the nodes.
   - Each unique circle corresponds to a node.
   - There are 10 distinct nodes in the graph.

2. Identify the edges:
   - The graph contains lines (edges) connecting the nodes.
   - There are numerous edges connecting the nodes in different directions.
   - By carefully observing, there are 14 unique edges in the graph.

3. Summarize your findings:
   - The graph has 10 nodes.
   - The graph has 14 edges.
   - The nodes and edges are both depicted in black.

4. Format your analysis:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. Both nodes and edges are depicted in black."
}
```
