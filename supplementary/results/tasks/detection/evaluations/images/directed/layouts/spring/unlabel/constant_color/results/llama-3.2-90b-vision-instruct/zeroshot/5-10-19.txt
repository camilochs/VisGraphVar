**Analysis of the Graph**

To answer this question, I will analyze the provided image step-by-step.

1. **Counting Nodes**: The image depicts a graph with circular nodes (representing vertices) connected by lines (edges). Counting them:
   - There are 10 nodes in total.

2. **Counting Edges**: Edges are the lines connecting these nodes. Counting them:
   - There are 15 edges connecting the nodes.

3. **Description and Colors**: 
   - The nodes are white.
   - The edges are black.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the graph consists of 10 nodes and 15 edges. All nodes are white, and all edges are black.
