The graph in the image can be analyzed as follows:

*   The graph contains 10 nodes.
*   The graph contains 16 edges.

The graph is a directed graph, meaning that each edge has an arrowhead indicating the direction of the connection between the nodes. The nodes are represented by circles, and the edges are represented by lines with arrowheads at one end.

Therefore, the analysis of the graph in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "The graph is a directed graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges. All nodes are white, and all Edges are black."
}
```
