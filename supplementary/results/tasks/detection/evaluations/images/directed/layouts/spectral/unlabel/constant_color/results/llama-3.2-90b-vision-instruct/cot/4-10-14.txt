**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   The graph contains 10 distinct nodes, represented by circles.
*   All nodes are white.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   There are 9 lines connecting the nodes.
*   All edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize findings**

*   Total number of nodes: 10
*   Total number of edges: 9
*   The graph has a white background with white nodes and black edges, forming a connected network.

**Step 4: Format answer in JSON**

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 9,
  "analysis": "A connected network with 10 white nodes and 9 black edges on a white background."
}
```
