Following the steps from your instructions:

**Step 1: Identify nodes, count each, note colors**

There are nodes in the graph. Each node is depicted as a circle, labeled and colored with no color visible.  

**Step 2: Identify edges, count each, note colors**

The lines connecting the nodes are edges. The graph contains edges and is also colored black.

**Step 3: Summarize results**

The total number of nodes is 11, with the total number of edges being 16. The graph is designed as a directed graph with black circles and lines on a white background.

**Step 4: Format answer in JSON**

```
{
  "total_nodes": 11,
  "total_edges": 16,
  "analysis": "Black lines connecting no colored circles on a white background."
}
```
