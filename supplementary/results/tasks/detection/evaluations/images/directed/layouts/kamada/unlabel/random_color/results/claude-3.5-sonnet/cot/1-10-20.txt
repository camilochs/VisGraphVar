Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph and present the findings in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 nodes in various colors (purple, blue, teal, light blue, yellow, light green, and brown) connected by 14 black edges. The nodes are of different sizes, with two larger teal nodes appearing to be central to the network. The graph has an irregular structure with no clear geometric pattern."
