Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes:
   - The nodes are represented by circles.
   - In this graph, there are 8 distinct circles (nodes).

2. Identify the edges:
   - The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.
   - There are 14 distinct lines (edges) connecting the nodes.

3. Summarize your findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 8
   - Total number of edges: 14
   - Description: The graph has multiple interconnected nodes formed by lines. The nodes are white, and the edges are black with arrows indicating the direction of the connections.

4. Format the analysis in JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph has 8 white nodes connected by 14 black edges with directional arrows. The nodes are interconnected, forming a complex network."
}
