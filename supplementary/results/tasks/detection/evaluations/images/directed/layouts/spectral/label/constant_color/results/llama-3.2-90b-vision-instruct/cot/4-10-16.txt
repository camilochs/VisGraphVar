The graph in the image has 10 nodes:

1. Node 0
2. Node 1
3. Node 2
4. Node 3
5. Node 4
6. Node 5
7. Node 6
8. Node 7
9. Node 8

And 16 edges between the following node pairs:

1. 0 and 3
2. 0 and 4
3. 0 and 5
4. 1 and 2
5. 1 and 4
6. 1 and 8
7. 2 and 3
8. 2 and 5
9. 2 and 6
10. 3 and 4
11. 3 and 7
12. 3 and 8
13. 4 and 7
14. 5 and 6
15. 6 and 8
16. 8 and 9

The analyzed information can be presented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "The graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. All edges and nodes are black." 
}
```

This representation provides a clear summary of the graph's structure and appearance.
