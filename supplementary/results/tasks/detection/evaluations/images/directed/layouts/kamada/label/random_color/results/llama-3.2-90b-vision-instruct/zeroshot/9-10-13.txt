**Step 1: Analyze the image to detect nodes and edges**

In the image, we can see multiple points or nodes connected by lines or edges. Here's a simplified version to help understand:

Node A (yellow) is connected to four other nodes.
Node B (blue) is connected to three nodes.
Node C (light blue) is connected to three other nodes.
Node D (dark blue) is connected to one another node.
Node E (pink) is connected to two additional nodes.
Node F (purple) is connected to one other node.
Node G (beige) is connected to one additional node.

**Step 2: Count the total number of nodes**

According to the image and based on our observations, nodes are distinguished by colors and non-string tags. These colors are:
- Yellow
- Blue
- Light blue
- Dark blue
- Pink
- Purple
- Beige

In addition, the image has multiple non-color nodes labeled with number tags. According to our analysis, their colors are:
- Olive green
- Light green
- Black
- Magenta
- Blue (to match the weight)

However, we should consider black and magenta as edge-connected nodes because black and magenta are connected to edges along with the nine number tags listed in our observations.

The final count of nodes marked with numbers is 9. Factoring in the color-only and multi-tag non-color nodes, the total count is 15.

**Step 3: Count the total number of edges**

Based on our previous analysis, each edge corresponds to the first tag going toward another tag or color. The most you can observe is two shaded nodes connected to each other via an edge. The connections between nodes would be easier to calculate if seen in multiple intersections or transit points.

This appears to be a practice diagram for understanding actuators, their epochs, speed, frequency, low-boundedness, or statecraft optimized in their lines. Counting these nodes and netting the transit points will help find the final count.

There are a total of 16 edges visible in the diagram.

**Conclusion**

We count 10 nodes and 13 edges in the image.

**JSON code**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 14,
    "analysis": "The diagram depicts a structure with multiple nodes displayed in a mix of number tags and shade colors for symmetry. The graph has varying tag distributions on geometry in one cycle. Nodes, also called vertices, have degrees from one to four. It is concluded that at least 10 out of 15 nodes are tagged and have non-color arrangements."
}
```

**Final answer**

The analysis of the diagram in the image gives a total of 10 nodes compared to 14 edges in the diagram. I hope this helps. For additional assistance with graph citations, reach out for help anytime you need it.
