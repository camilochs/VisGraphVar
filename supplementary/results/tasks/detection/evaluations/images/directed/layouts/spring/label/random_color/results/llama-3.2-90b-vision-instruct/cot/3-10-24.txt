* 7 (light blue)
* 8 (blue)
* 9 (black)

**Step 2: Identify the Edges**
There are 16 lines connecting the nodes.

**Step 3: Summarize Findings**

* Total Nodes: 9
* Total Edges: 16
* Graph Description: A network with 9 nodes in various colors (green, gray, dark green, brown, light green, dark blue, light blue, blue, and black) connected by 16 black lines.
