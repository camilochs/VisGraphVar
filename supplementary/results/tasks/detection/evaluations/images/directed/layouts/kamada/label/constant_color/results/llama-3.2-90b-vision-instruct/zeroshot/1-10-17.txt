**Analyzing the Graph**

To determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph, we can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Counting Nodes**

*   The graph contains numbered points, which we define as nodes.
*   We count each node individually to find the total:

    *   Node 0
    *   Node 1
    *   Node 2
    *   Node 3
    *   Node 4
    *   Node 5
    *   Node 6
    *   Node 7
    *   Node 8
    *   Node 9

    There are 10 nodes in total.

**Step 2: Counting Edges**

*   Edges are defined by the connecting lines between nodes.
*   We count each line as an edge, noting that some edges may connect the same two nodes (parallel edges), and all edges are directed (arrows indicate direction), making each edge unique despite potentially joining the same pair of nodes:

    *   From Node 0 to Node 1 (directed)
    *   From Node 0 to Node 4 (directed)
    *   From Node 1 to Node 0 (directed)
    *   From Node 1 to Node 5 (directed)
    *   From Node 1 to Node 7 (directed)
    *   From Node 1 to Node 8 (directed)
    *   From Node 2 to Node 0 (directed)
    *   From Node 2 to Node 5 (directed)
    *   From Node 2 to Node 1 (directed)
    *   From Node 3 to Node 1 (directed)
    *   From Node 3 to Node 5 (directed)
    *   From Node 4 to Node 2 (directed)
    *   From Node 5 to Node 3 (directed)
    *   From Node 6 to Node 7 (directed)
    *   From Node 7 to Node 6 (directed)
    *   From Node 8 to Node 1 (directed)
    *   From Node 9 to Node 3 (directed)

    There are 16 edges in total.

**Conclusion:**

The graph in the image contains 10 nodes and 16 edges. All nodes and edges are depicted in black.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "The graph is a directed graph with 10 nodes and 16 directed edges. All nodes and edges are in black."
}
