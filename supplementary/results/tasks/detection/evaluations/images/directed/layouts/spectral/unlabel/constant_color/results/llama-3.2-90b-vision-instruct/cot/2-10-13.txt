In the graph, we can see 10 distinct points or circles, which are the nodes. Each node is represented by a small white circle. 

We also notice that there are 9 lines connecting these nodes, which are the edges. These lines are black.

Now, let's put our findings into the required JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 9,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white nodes and 9 black edges, forming a simple connected network."
}
```
