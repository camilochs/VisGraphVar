Answer in JSON format:
```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 20,
  "analysis": "The graph is a directed graph with 9 nodes and 20 edges. All nodes and edges are black."
}
```
Explanation:

The graph contains 9 nodes, each represented by a circle with a number from 0 to 8. The nodes are connected by 20 edges, which are represented by lines with arrowheads indicating the direction of the connection. The colors of the nodes and edges are not specified in the image, but based on the black-and-white representation, it can be inferred that all nodes and edges are black.

Therefore, the total number of nodes is 9, and the total number of edges is 20. The graph is a directed graph, meaning that the direction of the connections between nodes matters.
