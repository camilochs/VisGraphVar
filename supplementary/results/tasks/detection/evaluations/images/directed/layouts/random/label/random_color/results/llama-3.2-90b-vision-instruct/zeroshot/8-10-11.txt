**Step 1: Analyze the Graph**

*   In this graph we see numbered nodes of various colors, and edges which connect pairs of nodes with arrows at the ends.

**Step 2: Count the Number of Nodes**

There are nine uniquely numbered nodes, therefore there are nine nodes.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Edges**

There are twelve edges indicated by arrows between the nodes of the graph.

**Step 4: Compile Results**
