**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

Looking at the graph in the image, there are distinct points or circles visible. Each of these points represents a node in the graph. Counting these unique nodes gives us a total of 10 nodes. The color of the nodes is black with a white background.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

Now, let's look for lines connecting the nodes. These lines are the edges of the graph. Counting these unique edges gives us a total of 16 edges. The color of the edges is black.

**Step 3: Summarize the findings**

Based on the analysis:

* Total number of nodes: 10
* Total number of edges: 16
* Brief description of the graph's appearance: The graph consists of 10 black nodes connected by 16 black edges against a white background.

**Step 4: Format the answer**

Here is the formatted answer in JSON format:

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 black nodes connected by 16 black edges against a white background."
}
```

This format adheres to the requested JSON structure.
