Sure! Let's analyze the graph step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

Step 1: Identify the nodes:
- The graph has distinct circular points (nodes) which can be counted.
- Each node appears white in color.
- Total nodes in the graph: 8

Step 2: Identify the edges:
- The graph has lines connecting the nodes (edges).
- Count each unique edge connecting the nodes.
- All edges are black in color.
- Total edges in the graph: 13

Step 3: Summarize the findings:
- Total number of nodes: 8
- Total number of edges: 13
- Description: The graph is irregular and interconnected with 8 white nodes and 13 black edges.

Step 4: Formatting the answer:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 13,
   "analysis": "The graph is irregular and interconnected with 8 white nodes and 13 black edges."
}
```
