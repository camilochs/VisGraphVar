**Step 1: Identify the Nodes**

*   There are distinct points or circles in the graph. Each of these is a node and should be counted.
*   The graph contains 10 nodes, each of a different color:
    *   Dark blue
    *   Purple
    *   Orange
    *   Turquoise
    *   Pink
    *   Black
    *   Chartreuse
    *   Yellow
    *   Navy blue
    *   Light purple

**Step 2: Identify the Edges**

*   Look for lines connecting the nodes.
*   There are 17 lines connecting the nodes, which represent 17 edges in the graph.
*   All edges are black in color.

**Step 3: Summarize Your Findings**

*   Total number of nodes: 10
*   Total number of edges: 17
*   Brief description of the graph's appearance: The graph consists of 10 nodes of varying colors connected by 17 black edges.
