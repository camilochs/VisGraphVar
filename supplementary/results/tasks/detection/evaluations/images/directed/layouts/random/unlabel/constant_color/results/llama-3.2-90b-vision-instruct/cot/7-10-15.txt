**Step 1: Identify the nodes**

*   There are 10 distinct points or circles in the graph.
*   Each unique node is counted once.
*   The nodes are all the same color, which is white.

**Step 2: Identify the edges**

*   There are 14 lines connecting the nodes.
*   Each unique edge is counted once.
*   The edges are all the same color, which is black.

**Step 3: Summarize your findings**

*   Total number of nodes: 10
*   Total number of edges: 14
*   Brief description of the graph's appearance: The graph has 10 white nodes and 14 black edges, arranged in a complex pattern with no clear structure or direction.

**Step 4: Format your answer**
