**Step 1: Identify existing elements within the image.**

While images are not present within the prompt, notes for each image can be summarized here:

### Image  1

This is a *property graph* with a total of *9 nodes* and *15 edges*. Including:

*   *Three* *directed* *solid* *pink* *edges*,
*   *Two* *directed* *dashed* *green* *edges*,
*   *Three* *undirected* *black* *edges*,
*   *Three* *undirected* *green* *edges*,
*   *Two* *directed* *solid* *blue* *edges*,
*   *Two* *directed* *dashed* *red* *edges* 

Of the *9 nodes*: 

*   3 are *solid* *pink* *colored*
*   2 are *red*

The remaining *4* nodes are different colors not mentioned in the prompt as outlined below.



### Image #2:

This property graph contains a total of *10* nodes and *17* edges. The graph’s edges consist of:

*   5 *solid* *directed* *black* *edges*
*   1 *undirected* *black* *edge*
*   2 *undirected* *black* *edges*

Of the 10 nodes present within the graph:

*   1 *blue* *solid* *edge*
*   4 nodes are *black*
*   1 node is *green*



**Step 2: Organize the information into the requested JSON format.** 

```json

[
 { 
    "total_nodes": 9, 
    "total_edges": 15, 

    "analysis": "This is a property graph with a total of 9 nodes and 15 edges. Including: Three directed solid pink edges, two directed dashed green edges, three undirected black edges, three undirected green edges, two directed solid blue edges, two directed dashed red edges. Of the 9 nodes: 3 are solid pink colored, 2 are red. The remaining 4 nodes are different colors not mentioned in the prompt"
 },

    "total_edges": 17, 

    "analysis": "This property graph contains a total of 10 nodes and 17 edges. The graph’s edges consist of: 5 solid directed black edges, 1 undirected black edge, 2 undirected black edges. Of the 10 nodes present within the graph: 1 blue solid edge, 4 nodes are black, 1 node is green"
