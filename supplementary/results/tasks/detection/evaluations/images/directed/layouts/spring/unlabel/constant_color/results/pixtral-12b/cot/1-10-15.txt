Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. **Identify the Nodes:**
   - The graph consists of circular points, which represent nodes.
   - I can see 8 circular nodes.

2. **Identify the Edges:**
   - The edges are the lines connecting these circular nodes.
   - There are 14 lines connecting the nodes.

3. **Summarize Your Findings:**
   - **Total Nodes:** 8
   - **Total Edges:** 14
   - **Description:** The graph has circular nodes connected by lines. The nodes and edges appear black.

4. **Formatted Answer:**
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 8 nodes and 14 edges. All nodes and edges are depicted in black."
}
