Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - The graph has 9 distinct nodes, all of which appear to be white circles.

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - The graph has 17 distinct edges, all of which are black lines with arrows.

3. **Summarize your findings:**
   - The total number of nodes (white circles) is 9.
   - The total number of edges (black lines with arrows) is 17.
   - The graph depicts a directed network with nodes connected by arrows indicating direction and flow.

4. **Format your answer:**
   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 9,
      "total_edges": 17,
      "analysis": "The graph is directed and contains 9 white nodes and 17 black directed edges."
   }
   ```

Thus, the analyzed data in JSON format is provided as above.
