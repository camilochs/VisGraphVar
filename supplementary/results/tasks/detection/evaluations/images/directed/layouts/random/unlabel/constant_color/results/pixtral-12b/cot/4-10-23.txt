Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the nodes
- We see several circles (nodes) in the graph.
- Counting each unique node, we have:
  - 13 nodes.

### Step 2: Identify the edges
- We see several lines (edges) connecting the nodes.
- Counting each unique line, we have:
  - 22 edges.

### Step 3: Summarize the findings
- Total number of nodes: 13
- Total number of edges: 22
- Description: The graph has 13 nodes, with many edges connecting them, some forming triangular structures, and others connecting nodes across the graph. The nodes are all white, and the edges are all black.

### Step 4: Format the answer in JSON

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 13,
   "total_edges": 22,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 13 white nodes and 22 black edges. Several edges connect various nodes, forming a complex network with some triangular patterns."
}
