**Step 1: Identifying Nodes.** 

The nodes in the graph are the individual points available for connection. Nodes are numbered between 0 and 9 and each is marked with a different but small circle.

**Step 2: Identifying Edges.**

Edges are represented in the image by lines which connect the nodes present in the graph. In the image, all edges are black in color.

**Step 3: Counting nodes and edges**

*   The nodes present total **10**. 
*   The edges present total **16**.

**Step 4: Graph analysis**

The black node color represents all nodes present in the graph. Each edge is black in color. This graph has a total of 10 black nodes and 16 black edges.

**Step 5: Assembling the response in JSON format**

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "This graph has 10 black nodes and 16 black edges"
}
```

**Final Answer**

This graph has 10 black nodes and 16 black edges.
