Following the steps you've outlined, here's the analysis of the graph in the image:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 14,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 white circular nodes connected by 14 black directed edges. The nodes are arranged in an irregular pattern, with some nodes having multiple connections and others having fewer. The edges are represented by arrows, indicating the direction of the relationship between nodes."
}
