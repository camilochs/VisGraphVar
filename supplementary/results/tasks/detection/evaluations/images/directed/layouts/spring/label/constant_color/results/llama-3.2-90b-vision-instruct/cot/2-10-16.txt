Based on the graph in the image, I have conducted an analysis of the number of nodes and edges. Here are my findings:

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - There are distinct points or circles in the graph.
   - I counted 9 unique nodes.
   - All nodes are white with a black border.

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - There are lines connecting the nodes.
   - I counted 16 unique edges.
   - All edges are black.

3. **Summarize my findings:**
   - The total number of nodes is 9.
   - The total number of edges is 16.
   - The graph features white nodes with a black border and black edges.

4. Format my answer in JSON:

   ```json
   {
     "total_nodes": 9,
     "total_edges": 16,
     "analysis": "This graph consists of 9 white nodes with a black border, connected by 16 black edges."
   }
   ```
