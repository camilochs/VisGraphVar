Following the steps provided, I'll analyze the graph in the image:

1. Identifying the nodes:
   - There are 9 distinct circular nodes in the graph.
   - All nodes are white circles with black outlines.

2. Identifying the edges:
   - There are 21 edges connecting the nodes.
   - All edges are black lines with arrows indicating direction.

3. Summary of findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 9
   - Total number of edges: 21
   - The graph appears to be a directed graph with circular nodes arranged in a roughly circular pattern, connected by arrows in various directions.

4. Formatted answer in JSON:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 21,
   "analysis": "The graph is a directed network with 9 white circular nodes arranged in a roughly circular pattern. The nodes are connected by 21 black arrows indicating directional relationships between the nodes."
}
