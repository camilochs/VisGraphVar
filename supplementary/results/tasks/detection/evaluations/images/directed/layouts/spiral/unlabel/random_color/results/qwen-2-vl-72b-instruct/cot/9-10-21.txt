To determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Identify the nodes:**
   - There are 10 distinct nodes in the graph.
   - The nodes are colored as follows:
     - Blue nodes: 2
     - Cyan nodes: 2
     - Red nodes: 1
     - Orange nodes: 1
     - Yellow nodes: 1
     - Magenta nodes: 1
     - Light green nodes: 1
     - Dark purple nodes: 1
     - Green nodes: 1

2. **Identify the edges:**
   - There are 30 edges in the graph.
   - The edges are represented by lines connecting the nodes.

3. **Summarize your findings:**
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 30
   - The graph appears to be a fully connected network with each node connected to every other node. The nodes are colored, and the edges are solid black lines.

4. **Format your answer:**

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 30,
  "analysis": "The graph is a fully connected network with 10 nodes of various colors and 30 edges connecting every node to every other node. The edges are represented by black lines."
}
