**Step 1: Identify the number of nodes in the graph**

Based on the graph in the image, there are 10 nodes (circles) present.

**Step 2: Identify the number of edges in the graph**

Based on the graph in the image, there are 16 lines connecting the 10 nodes (circles), each of which represents one edge of the graph. 

**Step 3: Formulate an answer for the prompt in the required JSON format.** 

```json
{
    "total_nodes": 10,
    "total_edges": 16,
    "analysis": "All the lines are black and the circles represent the nodes. They are simple in style and are vector art".      
}
```

**Conclusion**

The given graph possesses exactly 10 nodes and 16 edges. It also features a simple black-and-white color scheme, with nodes rendered as circles and edges represented by lines. This type of graph is often referred to as a simple directed graph, characterized by the absence of edge weights and the presence of directed edges (i.e., the arrowheads on each edge).
