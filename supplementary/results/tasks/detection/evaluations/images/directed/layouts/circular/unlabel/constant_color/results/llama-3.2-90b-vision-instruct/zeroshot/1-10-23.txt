**Step 1:** The image contains a black and white graph, where the nodes are represented by circles.  The nodes are black, and the edges connecting them are black as well. It can be observed that there are 10 nodes located in this graph

**Step 2:** We must next count the edges present in the graph to determine the total number. Edges are represented by lines joining the different nodes, and after a careful inspection, it can be observed that the total number of edges present in the above graph is 16.

**Step 3:** Finally, the request asks for the answer to be reported in a JSON format:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "The given graph has 10 black nodes. A total of 16 edges are connecting the nodes, which are black in color. Only two nodes are connected with one edge each. The other edges connect each vertex 1- 6 times with other vertices. There are multiple cycles present in this graph. Since some nodes are connected to every other node, they have 6 or more edges, indicating vertices with a high degree value."
}
```
The final answer is above.
