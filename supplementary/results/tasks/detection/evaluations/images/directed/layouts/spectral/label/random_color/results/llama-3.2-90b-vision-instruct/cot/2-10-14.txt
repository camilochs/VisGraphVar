**Analysis of the Graph**

To determine the number of nodes and edges in the graph, we will follow the steps outlined.

**Step 1: Identify the Nodes**

*   The graph contains 7 distinct points or circles.
*   Each unique node is counted: 7 nodes in total.
*   The nodes are colored as follows:
    *   Purple
    *   Blue (appears twice)
    *   Light blue
    *   Peach
    *   Yellow
    *   Green
    *   Grey/Black

**Step 2: Identify the Edges**

*   The graph contains lines connecting the nodes.
*   Each unique edge is counted: 11 edges in total.
*   The edges are black.

**Step 3: Summarize Findings**

*   Total nodes: 7
*   Total edges: 11
*   Brief description:
    *   The graph features 7 distinct points or circles (nodes) connected by 11 lines (edges).
    *   The nodes display a variety of colors, including purple, blue, light blue, peach, yellow, green, and grey/black.
    *   All edges are consistently black.

**Final Answer:**
