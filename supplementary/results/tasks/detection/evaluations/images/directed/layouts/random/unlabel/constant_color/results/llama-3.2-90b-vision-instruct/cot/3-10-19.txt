After analyzing the image using the step-by-step approach, I can provide the following JSON formatted answer:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 10,
  "total_edges": 17,
  "analysis": "The graph is undirected and contains 10 circular nodes, all of which are black. It also features 17 black edges connecting the nodes, with several edges overlapping at their junctures."
}
```

In summary, I've counted 10 distinct nodes and 17 unique edges in the provided graph image.
