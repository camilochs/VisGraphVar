**Property to determine:** Number of nodes and edges in the graph.

**Available data:**

* The graph has 8 nodes (represented by circles).
* Each node is connected to every other node, forming a complete graph.
* There are no isolated nodes or edges.
* All edges are monochromatic and appear as solid lines.

**Calculation:**

To calculate the number of edges in a complete graph, we can use the formula:

n(n-1)/2

where n is the number of nodes.

Plugging in the value of n=8, we get:

8(8-1)/2 = 28

Therefore, there are 28 edges in the graph.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 28,
   "analysis": "The graph is a complete graph with 8 nodes, where each node is connected to every other node. All edges are monochromatic and appear as solid lines."
