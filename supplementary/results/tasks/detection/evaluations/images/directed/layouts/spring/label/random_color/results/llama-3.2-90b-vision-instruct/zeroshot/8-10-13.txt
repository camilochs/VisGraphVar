**Property to determine:** Number of nodes, number of edges, and analysis of the graph.

**Available data:**

* The graph shows 9 nodes (circles) with numbers 0 through 8.
* Each node is colored differently.
* The edges are represented by arrows connecting the nodes.
* A diamond symbol represents an unknown quantity, which appears to be the direction of the edge if the arrow is not visible.

**Analysis:**

The most striking aspect of this graph is its multi-edged connectivity. Edges are depicted as arrows aimed at different nodes, highlighting the directed nature of this graph; and not simply joining edges between nodes, as edges in such a setting may be termed undirected.  

This design enables the representation of complex relationships within large datasets, making prototype analysis feasible. 

This may prove invaluable in fields like social network study, where analyzing such bonding complexities can reveal underlying patterns in individual relationships.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 8,
   "analysis": "A directed graph with diverse colored nodes, representing relationships between nodes using arrows for directionality."
}
```
