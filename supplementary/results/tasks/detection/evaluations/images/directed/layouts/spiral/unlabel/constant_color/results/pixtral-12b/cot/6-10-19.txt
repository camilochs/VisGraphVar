Let's carefully analyze the graph in the image to determine the number of nodes and edges.

### Step 1: Identify the Nodes
- The graph consists of 8 distinct circular points.
- All nodes are of the same color (blackend).

### Step 2: Identify the Edges
- The graph consists of 12 lines connecting the nodes.
- All edges are of the same color (black).

### Step 3: Summarize Findings
- The graph has 8 nodes and 12 edges.
- The nodes and edges are all black.

### Step 4: Format the Answer
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 8,
   "total_edges": 12,
   "analysis": "The graph is a directed graph with 8 nodes and 12 edges. All nodes and edges are black in color."
}
