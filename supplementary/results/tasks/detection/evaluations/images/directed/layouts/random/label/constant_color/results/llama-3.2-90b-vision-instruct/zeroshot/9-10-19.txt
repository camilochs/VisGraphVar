**Analysis of the Graph**

**Number of Nodes**
The graph contains a total number of **9 nodes**. Each node is sequentially numbered from 0 to 8.

**Number of Edges**
The graph also comprises **16 edges**, each depicted as an arrowhead line connecting two nodes.

**Graph Analysis (JSON Representation)**
Based on the above analysis, the JSON representation appears as follows:

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 16,
   "analysis": "The graph comprises black nodes sequentially numbered from 0 to 8 and black edges with arrowheads."
}
```

Note that the graph is directed, denoted by the arrowheads on the edges. These arrowheads indicate the direction of the edges' connections between the nodes.
