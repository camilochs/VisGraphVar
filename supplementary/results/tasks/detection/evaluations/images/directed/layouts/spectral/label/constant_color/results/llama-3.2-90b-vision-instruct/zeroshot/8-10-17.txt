**Graph Analysis: Node and Edge Count**

The provided image displays a graph with nodes and edges. To analyze the graph, we need to identify the number of nodes and edges.

**Node Count:**

*   Upon inspecting the graph, we can see that there are 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9.

**Edge Count:**

*   The graph contains 11 edges connecting the nodes.

**Analysis:**

*   The nodes in the graph are represented by white circles with black numbers inside them.
*   The edges are depicted as black lines connecting the nodes.

**JSON Format:**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 11,
   "analysis": "The graph contains 10 white nodes with black numbers and 11 black edges."
}
```
