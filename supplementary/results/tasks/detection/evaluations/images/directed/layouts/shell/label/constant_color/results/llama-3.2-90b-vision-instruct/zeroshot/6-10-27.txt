**Analysis of the Graph**

To analyze the graph, we need to count the number of nodes and edges present in the image.

**Step 1: Counting Nodes**

Upon examining the image, we can see that there are 10 distinct nodes labeled with numbers from 0 to 9. Each node is represented by a circle with a unique number inside it.

**Step 2: Counting Edges**

Next, we need to count the number of edges connecting these nodes. An edge is a line segment that connects two nodes. By carefully tracing the lines in the image, we can identify a total of 21 edges.

**Step 3: Describing the Graph**

The graph consists of 10 nodes (labeled 0 through 9) and 21 edges. All the nodes are black in color, while the edges are also black.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the graph has a total of 10 nodes and 21 edges. The nodes are represented by black circles with unique labels, and the edges are black lines connecting these nodes.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 10,
   "total_edges": 21,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of 10 black nodes labeled from 0 to 9, connected by 21 black edges."
