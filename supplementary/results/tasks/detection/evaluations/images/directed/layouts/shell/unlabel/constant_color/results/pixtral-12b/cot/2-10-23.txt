Let's analyze the graph in the image step by step to determine the number of nodes and edges.

1. Identifying the nodes:
   - The graph contains distinct points or circles. Each unique circle is considered a node.
   - Counting each unique node, there are 10 distinct nodes.

2. Identifying the edges:
   - The graph consists of lines connecting these nodes.
   - To count the edges, ensure that directed lines (arrows) between nodes are considered as unique edges.
   - After counting each unique edge, there are 21 edges in total.

3. Summarizing the findings:
   - Total number of nodes: 10
   - Total number of edges: 21
   - The graph appears to be directed (as indicated by arrows on the edges). The nodes and edges are black.

4. JSON Formatting the analysis:
   ```json
   {
      "total_nodes": 10,
      "total_edges": 21,
      "analysis": "The graph has a total of 10 nodes and 21 edges. The nodes and edges are black."
   }
   ```
