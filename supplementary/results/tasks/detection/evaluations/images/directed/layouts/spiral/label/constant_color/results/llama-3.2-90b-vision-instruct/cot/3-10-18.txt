**Analysis of the Graph**

### Step 1: Identify the Nodes

*   There are 9 distinct points or circles in the graph.
*   Each node is marked with a unique number from 0 to 8.
*   All nodes are black.

### Step 2: Identify the Edges

*   There are 17 lines connecting the nodes.
*   Each edge is represented by a solid black line.
*   There are no arrowheads on the lines, so the graph is undirected.

### Step 3: Summarize the Findings

*   The total number of nodes is 9.
*   The total number of edges is 17.
*   The graph is undirected and contains 9 black circled nodes marked with a unique number from 0 to 8 and 17 solid black lines.
