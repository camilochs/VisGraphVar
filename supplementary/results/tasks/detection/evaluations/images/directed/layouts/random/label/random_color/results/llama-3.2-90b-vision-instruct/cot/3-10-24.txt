Here is the definition of nodes and edges in a graph structure, referring to the image provided:

nodes:  The nodes are represented by distinct points or circles in the graph. There are 9 nodes in the image, each colored differently:

*   0: light green,
*   1: light pink,
*   2: light purple,
*   3: hot pink,
*   4: red,
*   5: dark gray,
*   6: medium purple,
*   7: blue,
*   8: dark purple,
*   9: yellow.

edges: The edges are represented by the lines connecting these nodes. There are 16 edges in the image. All edges are of the same dark color.

Based on the previous output, here is the corresponding JSON object:

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 9,
  "total_edges": 16,
  "analysis": "The graph has 9 distinct nodes, each a unique color. The nodes are connected by 16 edges of a dark color."
}
