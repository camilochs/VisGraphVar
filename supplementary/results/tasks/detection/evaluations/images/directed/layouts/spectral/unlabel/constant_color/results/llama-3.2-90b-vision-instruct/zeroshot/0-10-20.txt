**Graph Analysis**

The graph in the image has a total of **11 nodes** and **16 edges**. The nodes are represented by white circles, while the edges are depicted as black lines with arrowheads indicating directionality.

**Node and Edge Colors:**

*   Nodes: White
*   Edges: Black

**Total Nodes:** 11
**Total Edges:** 16

**Analysis:**

The graph exhibits a complex structure, with nodes connected to each other through directed edges. This suggests that there is a flow or relationship between the nodes, with some nodes having multiple incoming and outgoing edges. The presence of arrowheads on the edges indicates that the relationships between nodes are not symmetrical, implying that there may be a hierarchical or causal structure underlying the graph.

**JSON Output:**
