**Step 1: Counting the nodes**

To calculate the number of nodes in the graph, we need to count the circles. There are nine circles.

**Step 2: Counting the edges**

To determine the number of edges in the graph, we need to count the lines between the nodes. There are **18 lines** visible in the image.

**Conclusion**

The number of nodes is 9 and the number of edges is 18.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
   "total_nodes": 9,
   "total_edges": 18,
   "analysis": "In this graph, we have 9 nodes, each represented by a distinct color. The nodes are blue, brown, red, green, light blue, grey, violet, purple, and dark blue. We have 18 edges connecting these nodes. The edges represent the connections between the nodes. For example, the blue node is connected to the brown node, and the red node is connected to the green node."
