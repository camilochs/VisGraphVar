I'm happy to help you with that. However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to visually analyze images or access real-time information. I can provide you with a general framework for analyzing the graph and counting nodes and edges.

To provide an accurate answer, I would need you to describe the graph in the image, including the number of nodes and edges, and any notable features such as node and edge colors.

Once you provide the necessary information, I can help you format the answer in the required JSON format.

Here is a sample JSON format with placeholder values:
```json
{
   "total_nodes": 0,
   "total_edges": 0,
   "analysis": "Please provide a description of the graph"
}
```
Please provide the necessary information about the graph, and I'll be happy to assist you in completing the analysis.
