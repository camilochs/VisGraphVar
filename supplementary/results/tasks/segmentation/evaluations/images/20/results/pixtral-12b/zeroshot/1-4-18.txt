To identify the cut edge (bridge) in the provided graph, we need to analyze the connectivity of the edges. A cut edge is an edge such that removing it increases the number of connected components of the graph.

Here is the analysis of the graph:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(4, 18)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 4 and 18 splits the graph into two subgraphs: 

   - One subgraph containing nodes {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1, 0};

   - Another subgraph containing nodes {18, 19, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10}.
   "
}
```

In this particular graph, the edge between nodes 4 and 18 is a cut edge. Removing this edge will separate the graph into two disconnected subgraphs.
