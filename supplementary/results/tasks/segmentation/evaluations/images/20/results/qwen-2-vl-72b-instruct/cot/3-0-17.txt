   "cut_edge": "(7, 1)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 7 and 1 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and their connections, while the second subgraph contains the rest of the nodes (0, 8, 9, 10, 11, ..., 19) and their connections. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between the separated components, ensuring that the graph is cleanly divided into two subgraphs."
