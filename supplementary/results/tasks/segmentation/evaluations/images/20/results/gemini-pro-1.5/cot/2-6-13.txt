  "cut_edge": "(6, 13)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 6 and 13 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [14, 15, 12, 16, 11, 10, 19, 18, 17], while the second subgraph contains nodes [6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13]. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two sets of nodes, and removing this edge creates exactly two disconnected components."
