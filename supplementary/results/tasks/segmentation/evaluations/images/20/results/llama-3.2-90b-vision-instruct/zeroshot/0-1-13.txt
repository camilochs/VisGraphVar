**Step 1: Understand the concept of a cut edge (or bridge) in a graph.**

A cut edge (or bridge) is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In other words, it is an edge that connects two separate parts of the graph.

**Step 2: Identify the cut edge in the given graph visualization.**

Looking at the provided graph, we can see that the edge between nodes 9 and 0 connects two distinct parts of the graph. If this edge were removed, the graph would split into two separate subgraphs.

**Step 3: Provide the answer in the requested JSON format.**

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(9, 0)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 9 and 0 splits the graph into two subgraphs: one containing nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and the other containing nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19."
}
