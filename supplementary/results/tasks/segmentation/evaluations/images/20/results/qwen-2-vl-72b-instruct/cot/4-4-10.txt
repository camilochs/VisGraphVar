   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [10] and [4] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], while the second subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between these two sets of nodes, and removing this edge creates exactly two subgraphs, each of which remains internally connected."
