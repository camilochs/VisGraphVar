   "cut_edge": "(6, 7)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [6] and [7] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [10], [11], [16], [17], [18], [19] and their connections, while the second subgraph contains nodes [7], [8], [9], [12], [13], [14], [15] and their connections. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between the nodes in the separated components, ensuring that each remains internally connected without any additional connections between them."
