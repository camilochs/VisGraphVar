   "cut_edge": "(4, 18)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 4 and 18 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The second subgraph contains nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. This is a cut edge because it is the only edge that, when removed, separates the graph into two disconnected components. There is no alternative path between the two subgraphs that could keep them connected."
