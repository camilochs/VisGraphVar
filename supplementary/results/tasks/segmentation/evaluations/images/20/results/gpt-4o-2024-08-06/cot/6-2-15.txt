   "cut_edge": "(2, 15)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 2 and 15 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, forming a loop with node 2 connected internally. The second subgraph contains nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, forming an elongated loop with node 15 connected internally. This is a cut edge because nodes 2 and 15 are the sole connection between these two components, and removing it results in no alternative paths to reach either subgraph from the other."
