To determine the cut edge in the given graph, we need to identify the edge whose removal would split the graph into two disconnected subgraphs. Here's an analysis of the provided graph:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(13, 4)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 13 and 4 splits the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph includes nodes 13, 12, 11, 10, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, and 14. The second subgraph includes nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 0, 2, 1, and 9. This division creates two separate components, highlighting that edge (13, 4) is the cut edge."
}
```
By removing the edge between nodes 13 and 4, the graph is effectively split into two separate sections, thereby identifying (13, 4) as the cut edge.
