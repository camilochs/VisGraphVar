**Step 1: Identify the connected components in the graph**

We can see that the graph has multiple connected components. A connected component is a subgraph of the graph in which all the vertices can be reached. The two easiest ones to identify are 0 and 15 with their directly connected nodes, another one of 2, 3, and 4. 5 and 6. 1 and 7. and 8 and 9.

**Step 2: Look for the edges that separate these connected components**

Looking through these 7 cycles we can see the nodes connect due to 0 and 16 and 15 and 16. 17 also only connects 18 and 19. 0 and 17 would need to be part of one group. 15 and 17 would also be one, but 0, 15, and 17 cannot be together as all connected so 0 must be one group, 15, 16, and 17 must be another. 

**Step 3: Analyze the impact of removing each edge on the connected components**

We have two groups which seem to connect via 0, 16, 15, and 17. An inspection of 0 and its connection shows that 17 appears to connect 0 and 16. Hence, our cut edge would need to contain 17.

**Conclusion:**

After identifying and isolating all of the different groups we can see the only edge to connect these groups is **(0,17)**. Thus, **(0,17)** is clearly the only edge connecting the two main network clusters. 

Here is the JSON response: 

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(0, 17)",
   "analysis": "Removing this edge would divide the graph into two non-connected subgraphs: one containing nodes [0,6,5,2,9,8] and another containing nodes [15,14,13,12,11,10,18,19,16,17]"
}
