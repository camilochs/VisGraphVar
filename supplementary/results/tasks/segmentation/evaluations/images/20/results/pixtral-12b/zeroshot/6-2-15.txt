To identify the cut edge, we need to analyze the graph structure and determine which edges, when removed, would disconnect the graph. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(2, 15)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 2 and 15 splits the graph into two subgraphs:\n\n1. Subgraph 1 contains nodes [0, 1, 9, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5]\n2. Subgraph 2 contains nodes [16, 17, 18, 19, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n\nThus, the edge (2, 15) is a cut edge as its removal disconnects the overall structure into two separate parts."
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph can be observed to be composed of vertices connected to form a single connected network.
- By removing the edge between nodes 2 and 15, we find that the graph splits into two distinct subgroups. 
- This demonstrates that the edge (2, 15) is a bridge, and its removal,(or identification as a "cut vertex") will segment the graph into two separate subgraphs.
