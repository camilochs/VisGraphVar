  "cut_edge": "(7, 14)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 7 and 14 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], forming a cycle. The second subgraph contains nodes [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], also forming a cycle.  This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between these two cyclic subgraphs. Removing any other edge would leave the respective cycle intact."
