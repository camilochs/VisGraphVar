  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 2 and 15 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, forming a cycle of length 10. The second subgraph contains nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, also forming a cycle of length 10. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two cycles, and its removal disconnects the graph into exactly two components."
