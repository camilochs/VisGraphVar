   "cut_edge": "(5, 6)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [5] and [6] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], while the second subgraph contains nodes [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. This is a cut edge because removing it disconnects the graph into two separate components, and there is no alternative path that maintains connectivity between these components."
