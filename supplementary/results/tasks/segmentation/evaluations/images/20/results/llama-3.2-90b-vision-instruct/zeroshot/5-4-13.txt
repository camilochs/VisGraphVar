Based on the provided graph visualization:

The graph is a simple, undirected graph with 20 nodes labeled 0 through 19. The graph has 21 edges. To identify the cut edge, we need to find an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components. 

Upon inspection, we observe that edge (3,4) is the cut-edge. If (3,4) is removed, then there will be two subgraphs. One subgraph will have 9 nodes, labeled 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, and the other subgraph will also have 9 nodes, labeled 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 2.

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(3,4)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 3 and 4 split the graph into two subgraphs: One subgraph will have 9 nodes, labeled 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and the other subgraph will also have 9 nodes, labeled 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 2,  4, 0, 1."
}```

Here, 4 is connected to 0 and 1 of the first subgraph through node 2.
