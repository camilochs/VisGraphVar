   "cut_edge": "(4, 18)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [4] and [18] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0-9, which is a cycle. The second subgraph contains nodes 10-19, which is also a cycle. This is a cut edge because it is the only connecting edge between the two cycles, and removing it results in exactly two disconnected components."
