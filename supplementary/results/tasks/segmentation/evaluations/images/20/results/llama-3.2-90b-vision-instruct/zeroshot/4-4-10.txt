**Analysis of Graph Visualization**

Upon examining the graph visualization, I have identified the cut edge that, when removed, divides the graph into two separate subgraphs.

**Cut Edge Identification**

The cut edge is: (4, 10)

**Impact of Removing the Cut Edge**

Removing the edge between nodes 4 and 10 splits the graph into two subgraphs:

*   One subgraph contains nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
*   The other subgraph contains nodes 0, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the removal of the edge between nodes 4 and 10 results in the division of the graph into two disconnected subgraphs.
