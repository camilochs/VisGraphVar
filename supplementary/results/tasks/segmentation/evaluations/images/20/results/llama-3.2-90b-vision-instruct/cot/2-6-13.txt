Step 1: Identify all the edges in the given graph.

| Edge | Nodes |
| :--- | :---- |
| 1    | (2,3) |
| 2    | (2,0) |
| 3    | (0,9) |
| 4    | (3,0) |
| 5    | (0,5) |
| 6    | (5,6) |
| 7    | (5,7) |
| 8    | (7,8) |
| 9    | (9,0) |
| 10   | (10,0) |
| 11   | (10,11) |
| 12   | (11,12) |
| 13   | (12,13) |
| 14   | (13,14) |
| 15   | (14,15) |
| 16   | (15,10) |
| 17   | (10,11) |
| 18   | (16,17) |
| 19   | (17,18) |
| 20   | (16,19) |

Step 2: Remove each edge one by one to check if the graph becomes disconnected and count the number of nodes in each resulting component.

| Edge | Nodes | Disconnected? | Nodes in Resulting Components |
| :--- | :---- | :------------ | :---------------------------- |
| 1    | (2,3) | yes           | 5, 11                        |
| 2    | (2,0) | yes           | 5, 11                        |
| 3    | (0,9) | yes           | 5, 11                        |
| ...  | ...   | ...           | ...                          |
| 20   | (16,0) | yes           | 5, 11                        |

Step 3: Confirm there is no alternative path between the separated components.


False

Step 4: Verify no other path exists that could keep the components connected.


 False

Step 5: Analyze the resulting subgraphs.

*   Each subgraph has 5 nodes
*   Both subgraphs remain internally connected
*   Ensure no other connections exist between them
*   Removing this edge creates exactly two subgraphs

    ```json
{
  "cut_edge": "(10, 16)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [10] and [16] divides the graph into two subgraphs. Each subgraph contains 5 nodes. The first subgraph contains nodes [14, 13, 11, 15, 12]. The second subgraph contains nodes [10, 16, 7, 4, 9]. This is a cut edge because no other path exists that could keep the components connected and the edge is critical to keeping the graph connected"
