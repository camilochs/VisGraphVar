**Determining the Cut Edge with a Bridge in a Graph**

### Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Bridges

A bridge is a singular edge in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components between its endpoints. A graph can contain multiple bridges.

### Step 2: Output Data

Based on analysis, there is more than one cut edge in the graph. For the purpose of this question, one will be chosen:

```
{
 "cut_edge": "(12, 13)",
 "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 12 and 13 splits the graph into two separate subgraphs. The first component contains the nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0} and the second component has the nodes {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. There are 11 nodes in the first connected component and 10 nodes in the second connected component."
}
```

### Conclusion

The removal of the cut edge between nodes 12 and 13 splits the graph into two separate subgraphs: one with 11 nodes and the other with 10 nodes. 

Answer: The graph will be split into two separate subgraphs when the edge between nodes 12 and 13 is removed. The first subgraph will have 11 nodes, and the second subgraph will contain 10 nodes.
