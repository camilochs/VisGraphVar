   "cut_edge": "(0, 4)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [0] and [4] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3], while the second subgraph contains nodes [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between the two subgraphs, and removing it ensures no alternative paths exist between them."
