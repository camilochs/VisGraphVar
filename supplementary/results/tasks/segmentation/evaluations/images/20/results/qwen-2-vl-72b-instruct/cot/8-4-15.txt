   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [4] and [5] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9] with 9 nodes, while the second subgraph contains nodes [5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] with 11 nodes. This is a cut edge because it is the only edge connecting the nodes in the two subgraphs, and no alternative path exists to keep the components connected."
