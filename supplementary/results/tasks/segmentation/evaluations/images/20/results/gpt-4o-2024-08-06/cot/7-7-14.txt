   "cut_edge": "(7, 14)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [7] and [14] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], while the second subgraph contains nodes [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between these two sets of nodes, and its removal disconnects the graph into exactly two separate components with no alternative paths between them."
