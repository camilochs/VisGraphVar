After analyzing the graph, the identified cut edge that divides the graph into two separate subgraphs is as follows:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(17, 0)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [17] and [0] splits the graph into two subgraphs. One subgraph contains nodes [8, 9, 7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4] connected in a particular pattern, and the other contains nodes [17, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 19, 18] forming a cycle."
}
```
