   "cut_edge": "(4, 15)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [4] and [15] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes forming a cycle from node 0 through node 9, including nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The second subgraph contains nodes 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 19, 16, 17, 18. This is a cut edge because removing it disconnects the graph into exactly two components and there is no alternative path that connects the components."
