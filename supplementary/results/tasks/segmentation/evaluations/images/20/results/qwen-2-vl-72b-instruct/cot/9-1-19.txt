   "cut_edge": "(1, 19)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 19 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0 to 3 and nodes 19 to 20, while the second subgraph contains nodes 4 to 9 and nodes 10 to 18. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between these two subgraphs, ensuring no other connections exist between them."
