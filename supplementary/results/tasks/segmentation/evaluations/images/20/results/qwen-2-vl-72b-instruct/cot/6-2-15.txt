   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [2] and [15] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and their respective connections, while the second subgraph contains nodes [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and their respective connections. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between the separated components, and removing this edge creates exactly two subgraphs that remain internally connected."
