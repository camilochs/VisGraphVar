Here is the analysis of the graph in the given format:

*   **Step 1: List of potential cut edges**

    *   Potential candidates for cut edges: (0, 17), (15, 16), (16, 18)
*   **Step 2: Remove each edge and check the connectivity of each resulting graph**

    *    If we remove (0, 17), the graph becomes disconnected as (0, 17) is the only connection between the subgraph consisting 0, 8, 9, 1, and 6, 2, 3, 4, 5, and the subgraph consisting 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19.
        *   Count the number of nodes in each resulting component: 
            *   Subgraph 1: 9
            *   Subgraph 2: 7
    *   If we remove (15, 16), the graph does not become disconnected. There is an alternative path between (16) to (15) through the edges (16) to (18) and 18 to 15.
        *   Count the number of nodes in each resulting component: 
            *   Subgraph 1: 15
            *   Subgraph 2: 1
    *   If we remove (16, 18), the graph does not become disconnected. There is an alternative path between (16) to (18) through the edges (16) to (15) and 15 to 18.
        *   Count the number of nodes in each resulting component: 
            *   Subgraph 1: 15
            *   Subgraph 2: 1
*   **Step 3: Confirm the properties of the identified cut edge**

    *   The edge that has no alternative paths: (0, 17)
    *   Verify that removing this edge exactly creates two subgraphs consisting of all the nodes: yes
    *    Verify whether any connections exist between the subgraphs: yes

**Final Analysis:**

*   **Cut Edge:**

    (0, 17)
*   **Count the number of nodes in each subgraph:**

    Subgraph 1:  9
    Subgraph 2: 7

The final answer: 
```json
{
  "cut_edge": "(0, 17)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 0 and 17 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, while the second subgraph contains nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19. This is a critical edge (cut edge) because removing this edge creates exactly two subgraphs with no other connection between them, and it represents the minimum size cut, i.e., there is no other way to separate the graph with less than the number of edges in this edge cut."
}
```
This is the cut edge as it separates the graph into two subgraphs and fulfills the requirement of minimum cut i.e., there is no other connection between these subgraphs.
