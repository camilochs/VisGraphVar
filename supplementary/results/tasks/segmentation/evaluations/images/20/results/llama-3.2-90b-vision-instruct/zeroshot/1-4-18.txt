Analyzing the graph shows one cut edge: the edge connecting nodes 4 and 18. This edge is the only connection between the two halves of the graph and is essential for maintaining the graph's connectivity.

**Cut Edge and Subgraphs**

The cut edge in this graph is between nodes 4 and 18. When this edge is removed, the graph splits into two separate subgraphs:

*   **Subgraph 1 (Upper Half):** Consists of nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, forming an interconnected loop.
*   **Subgraph 2 (Lower Half):** Comprises nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, forming a separate, interconnected loop.

**Conclusion**

Therefore, removing the edge between nodes 4 and 18 divides the graph into two separate subgraphs.
