  "cut_edge": "(1, 8)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 8 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], while the second subgraph contains nodes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two sets of nodes once the edge (1, 8) is removed."
