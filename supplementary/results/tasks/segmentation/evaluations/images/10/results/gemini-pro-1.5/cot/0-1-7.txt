  "cut_edge": "(1, 7)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 7 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, forming a cycle. The second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, forming a cycle. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two cycles; removing this edge completely disconnects them, creating two distinct components."
