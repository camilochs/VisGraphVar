   "cut_edge": "(5, 2)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 5 and 2 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. The second subgraph contains nodes 2, 1, 0, 3, and 4. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between the two subgraphs, and removing this edge creates exactly two distinct subgraphs."
