   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [0] and [5] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 6, 8, 7, and 9. This subgraph is internally connected with paths between these nodes. The second subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. This subgraph is also internally connected with paths between these nodes. This is a cut edge because it is the only edge connecting the two subgraphs, and there is no alternative path between them."
