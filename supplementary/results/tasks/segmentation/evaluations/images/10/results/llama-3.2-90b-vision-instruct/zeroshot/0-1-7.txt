**Step 1: Identify the Solution Structure**

To determine if removing an edge is going to result in an increase in the number of connected components, we will iterate over all the edges in the graph and temporarily remove them. We then need to find whether the remaining graph is connected or not. In the context of graph theory, a graph is defined as 'connected' if there is a path between every pair of vertices. This process can be simplified by using depth-first search (DFS), because if a graph has n number of vertices and DFS perceives more or less than this number of vertices, the graph isn't connected.

**Step 2: Problem-Specific Solution Structure**

In the given accompanying graph figure, the vertices can be categorized into sets {1,2,3,4,0} and the rest of the vertices {6,7,8,9,5} with node 1 as the pivot element. This doesn't allow vertex (0) to be reachable from the second set of vertices.

Suppose the edge between 0 and 4 is cut off or removed, the first set {1,2,3,4,0} will be disconnected from the rest of the vertices in the second set {6,7,8,9,5}. The first set has a distinct identity of 1, which isn't aggregated with the remaining set of vertices from the graph. 

**Step 3: Argument Rationale**

The general argument that the edge joining nodes 0 and 4 is a cut edge is given below in JSON format:
```json
{
  "cut_edge": "(0, 4)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 0 and 4 splits the graph into two subgraphs: The first set of vertices {1,2,3,4,0} which is distinct and not reachable from the remaining set of vertices consisting of (6,7,8,9,5)."
}
