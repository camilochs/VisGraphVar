To determine the cut edge in the graph, we need to identify the edge whose removal would increase the number of connected components. Here is the analysis of the given graph:

1. Node `0` is connected to both Node `1` and Node `4`.
2. Node `3` is connected to both Node `2` and Node `4`.
3. Node `5` is connected to both Node `4` and Node `9`.
4. Node `6` is connected to both Node `4` and Node `7`.
5. Node `9` is also connected to Node `5`.
6. Nodes `7`, `8`, and `9` are interconnected, forming a subgraph.

Given the connectivity of the graph, node `4` acts as a central connecting node. Removing any edge connected to this central node `4` will separate the graph into multiple sections. Specifically, removing the edge connected to node `4` from node `5` or node `6` will break the graph into separate components.

Let's consider the edge between `4` and `5`:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(4, 5)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 4 and 5 splits the graph into two subgraphs: 
               - Subgraph 1: Nodes {4, 0, 1, 3, 2}
               - Subgraph 2: Nodes {5, 9, 8, 7}",
   "details": "Node 4 is a central node with multiple connections. Removing the edge between nodes 4 and 5 disrupts the connectivity, leading to two separate subgraphs."
}
```
