To determine the cut edge in the given graph, we need to identify the single edge whose removal will increase the number of connected components in the graph. In this graph, a cut edge is an edge that, when removed, will isolate a vertex or a subset of vertices from the rest of the graph.

The provided graph appears as follows:
```
      9
     / \
    /   \
   8-----5
  /       \
 7         0
 \         /
 6        /\
     1   /  \
      \ /    \
       2-----3
       \
        \
         4
```

After analyzing the graph, it is clear that the edge between vertices 1 and 2 is the cut edge.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(1, 2)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 2 splits the graph into two subgraphs: one containing the subset of nodes {0, 4, 3, 2} and the other containing the subset of nodes {5, 8, 7, 6, 9, 1}."
}
