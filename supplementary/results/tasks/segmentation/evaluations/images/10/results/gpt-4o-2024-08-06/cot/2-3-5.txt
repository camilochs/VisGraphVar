   "cut_edge": "(3, 5)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [3] and [5] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, while the second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between these two subgraphs, and removing this edge creates exactly two disconnected components."
