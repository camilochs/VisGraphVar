   "cut_edge": "(5, 6)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 5 and 6 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 5, 9, 8, 7, and the edges connecting them. The second subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the edges connecting them. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between the separated components, and removing this edge creates exactly two subgraphs without any other connections between them."
