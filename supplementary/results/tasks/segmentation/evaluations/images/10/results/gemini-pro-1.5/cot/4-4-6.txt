  "cut_edge": "(4, 6)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [4] and [6] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], while the second subgraph contains nodes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two sets of nodes, and removing this edge disconnects the graph into exactly two components. Each subgraph remains internally connected, but there are no remaining connections between them after the removal of edge (4, 6)."
