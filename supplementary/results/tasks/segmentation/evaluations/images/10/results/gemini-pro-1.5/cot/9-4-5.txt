  "cut_edge": "(4, 5)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 4 and 5 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, forming a small network. The second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, forming another interconnected group. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two sets of nodes, and removing it creates exactly two disconnected components."
