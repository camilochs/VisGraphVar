Certainly! By analyzing the provided graph, we can identify the cut edge as follows:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(1, 6)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 6 splits the graph into two subgraphs:\n- The top group, which includes nodes 3, 4, 2, 0, and 1, forms one subgraph.\n- The bottom group, which includes nodes 5, 6, 7, 9, and 8, forms the other subgraph."
}
```
