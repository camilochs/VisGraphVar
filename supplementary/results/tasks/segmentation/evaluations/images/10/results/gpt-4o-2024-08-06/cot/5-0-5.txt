   "cut_edge": "(0, 5)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 0 and 5 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, while the second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is a cut edge because it is the only direct connection between the two sets of nodes, and there is no alternative path between these components."
