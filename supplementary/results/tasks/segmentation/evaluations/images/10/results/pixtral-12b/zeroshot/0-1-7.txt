Based on an analysis of the provided graph visualization, the critical cut edge (or bridge) that, when removed, would divide the graph into two separate subgraphs is:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(1, 2)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [1] and [2] splits the graph into two subgraphs: One subgraph containing nodes [4], [0], and [1], and another subgraph containing nodes [3], [2], [6], [5], [9], and [8]."
}
```

Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 2 effectively separates the graph into two disconnected subgraphs, thereby satisfying the definition of a cut edge.
