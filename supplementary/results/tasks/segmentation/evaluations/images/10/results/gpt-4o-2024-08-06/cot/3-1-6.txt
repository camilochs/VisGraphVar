   "cut_edge": "(1, 6)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [1] and [6] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, while the second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path connecting nodes [1] and [6], and removing this edge results in exactly two disconnected subgraphs with no other connections between them."
