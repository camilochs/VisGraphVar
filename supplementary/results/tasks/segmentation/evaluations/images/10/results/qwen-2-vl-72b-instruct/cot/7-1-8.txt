{
   "cut_edge": "(8, 1)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [8] and [1] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and their internal connections, while the second subgraph contains nodes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and their internal connections. This is a cut edge because when this edge is removed, there are no alternative paths between the two subgraphs, making it critical in maintaining the connectivity of the entire graph."
