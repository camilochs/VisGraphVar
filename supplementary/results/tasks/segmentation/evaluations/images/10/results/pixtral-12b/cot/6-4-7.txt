Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step to identify the critical cut edge.

1. **Identify all edges in the graph:**

   The graph has the following edges:
   - (2, 1)
   - (3, 1)
   - (3, 0)
   - (0, 4)
   - (4, 7)
   - (7, 6)
   - (5, 6)
   - (5, 9)
   - (6, 8)

2. **For each potential cut edge:**

   - Experiments with removing each edge one by one to check if the graph becomes disconnected.

   - Edges are:
     - (2, 1)
     - (3, 1)
     - (3, 0)
     - (0, 4)
     - (4, 7)
     - (7, 6)
     - (5, 6)
     - (5, 9)
     - (6, 8)

   - Removing (5, 6) results in the graph being split into two separate components:
     - Component 1: [1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 7]
     - Component 2: [5, 6, 8, 9]

   - Removing any other edge makes the graph still connected, thus (5, 6) is a potential candidate for a cut edge.

3. **Verify the cut edge properties:**

   - Removing (5, 6) leaves no alternative path between the two components.
   - Confirm (5, 6) creates exactly two subgraphs.
   - Ensure no other path exists between the separated components.

4. **Analyze the resulting subgraphs:**

   - Component 1 (including 1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 7) remains internally connected.
   - Component 2 (including 5, 6, 8, 9) remains internally connected.
   - No other connections exist between subgraphs.

Based on the above analysis, the critical cut edge is identified as (5, 6).

**Final Analysis:**

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(5, 6)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 5 and 6 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 7], while the second subgraph contains nodes [5, 6, 8, 9]. This is a cut edge because removing this edge results in the graph being split into two disconnected components with no alternative path between them."
