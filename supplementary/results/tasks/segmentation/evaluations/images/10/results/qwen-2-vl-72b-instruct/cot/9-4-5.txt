   "cut_edge": "(5, 0)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 5 and 0 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, which are all connected through node 5 and node 4 to node 3, and finally to node 2 and node 1. The second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, which are all connected through node 5 to node 6, and finally to node 7, node 8, and node 9. This is a cut edge because removing it creates exactly two subgraphs, and there is no alternative path between these subgraphs that could keep them connected."
