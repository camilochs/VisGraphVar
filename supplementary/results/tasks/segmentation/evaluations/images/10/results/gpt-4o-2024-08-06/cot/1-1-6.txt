   "cut_edge": "(1, 6)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [1] and [6] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], while the second subgraph contains nodes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between these two sets of nodes, and its removal results in two disconnected components, each of which remains internally connected."
