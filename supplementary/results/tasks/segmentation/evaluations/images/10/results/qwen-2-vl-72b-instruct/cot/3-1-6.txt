   "cut_edge": "(6, 7)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 6 and 7 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, while the second subgraph contains nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between the separated components. The graph becomes disconnected when this edge is removed, and no other edges connect the two subgraphs."
