**Step 1: Identify the Cut Edge**

A cut edge is a single edge whose removal increases the number of connected components. To find the cut edge, we need to analyze the structure of the graph and identify the edges that play a critical role in connecting different subgraphs.

**Step 2: Analyze the Graph Structure**

The given graph has 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9 and 9 edges connecting these nodes. The edges are as follows:

* Edge 1: Connects nodes 0 and 1
* Edge 2: Connects nodes 1 and 2
* Edge 3: Connects nodes 0 and 3
* Edge 4: Connects nodes 2 and 0
* Edge 5: Connects nodes 3 and 5
* Edge 6: Connects nodes 5 and 6
* Edge 7: Connects nodes 6 and 7
* Edge 8: Connects nodes 7 and 8
* Edge 9: Connects nodes 5 and 9

**Step 3: Determine the Cut Edge**

Upon analyzing the graph structure, it is clear that removing the edge between nodes 5 and 9 would disconnect the graph into two separate subgraphs.

**Conclusion:**

The cut edge is the one between nodes 5 and 9. Removing this edge splits the graph into two subgraphs: one containing nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, and another containing nodes 8 and 9.
