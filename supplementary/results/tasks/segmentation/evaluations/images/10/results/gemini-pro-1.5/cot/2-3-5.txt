  "cut_edge": "(3, 5)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 3 and 5 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, forming a cycle and remaining connected. The second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 also forming a cycle and remaining internally connected. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two sets of nodes, and its removal creates exactly two disconnected components."
