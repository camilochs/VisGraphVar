   "cut_edge": "(5, 6)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 5 and 6 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which are connected within the left branch of the graph. The second subgraph contains nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9, which are connected within the right branch of the graph. This is a cut edge because no alternative path exists that could keep the components connected, and removing this edge ensures there are exactly two subgraphs formed."
