   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 6 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6], which form a connected component. The second subgraph contains nodes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], which also form a connected component. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between the separated components, and removing this edge creates exactly two subgraphs."
