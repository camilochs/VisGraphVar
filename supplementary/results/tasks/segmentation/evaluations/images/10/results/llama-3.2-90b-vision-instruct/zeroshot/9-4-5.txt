The graph contains 9 nodes (0-8) and 10 edges. There exists a cut edge, as the graph is not a complete graph, considering an edge needs to be removed to disconnect it.



The edge (3,0) connects two larger components. If we remove this edge, the nodes 0, 1, and 4 will be disconnected from the rest of the graph. So, the cut edge that, when removed, splits the graph into two separate components is the edge connecting nodes 3 and 0.

**Solution:**


```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(3, 0)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 3 and 0 splits the graph into two subgraphs: one containing nodes 0, 1, and 4, and another containing the remaining nodes."
}
```
