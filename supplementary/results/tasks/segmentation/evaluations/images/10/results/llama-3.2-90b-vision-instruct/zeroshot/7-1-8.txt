**Graph Analysis**

### Step 1: Identify Nodes and Edges

The graph consists of nodes labeled 0 to 9, connected by edges.

### Step 2: Determine Edge Removal Impact

Removing an edge increases the number of connected components, making it a cut edge (or bridge). Examining the removal effect on each edge:

*   **Edge (0, 4):** Non-removable, as node 4 has an alternative path to the rest of the graph through node 3.
*   **Edge (1, 3):** The only path from nodes 1 and 2 to the rest of the graph. Removing it splits the graph into two separate subgraphs:
    *   **Subgraph 1:** Nodes 1 and 2.
    *   **Subgraph 2:** Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, removing the edge between nodes 1 and 3 splits the graph into two subgraphs:

*   **Subgraph 1:** Nodes 1 and 2.
*   **Subgraph 2:** Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
