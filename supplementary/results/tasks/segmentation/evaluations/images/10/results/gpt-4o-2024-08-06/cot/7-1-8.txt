   "cut_edge": "(1, 8)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 8 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, while the second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between these two sets of nodes, and removing this edge results in exactly two disconnected subgraphs."
