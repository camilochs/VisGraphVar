{
   "cut_edge": "(4, 7)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [4] and [7] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], while the second subgraph contains nodes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between subgraph [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and subgraph [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Removing this edge ensures that no alternative path exists that could keep the subgraphs connected."
