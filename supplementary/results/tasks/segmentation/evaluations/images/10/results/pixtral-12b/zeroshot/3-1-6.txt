To identify the cut edge, we need to find an edge whose removal from the graph would result in the graph being divided into two separate subgraphs.

Let's analyze the graph:

```
    9 - 5 - 6 - 1
     | /|
     8-7-6 
      \ 
       0
     / \
    2 - 1
   /     \
 3 ----- 4
```

The edges are as follows:
- (9, 5)
- (5, 6)
- (6, 1)
- (8, 7)
- (7, 6)
- (0, 6)
- (0, 1)
- (2, 1)
- (3, 2)
- (4, 2)

Each node is connected to one or more nodes, indicating whether removing an edge will split the graph into separate subgraphs.

The edge that acts as a cut edge must be analyzed. The one edge that clearly separates the rest of the graph into two parts is:

- (1, 6)

Removing the edge (1, 6) splits the graph into two distinct subgraphs:

1. Subgraph 1: Nodes {0, 2, 3, 4}
2. Subgraph 2: Nodes {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Here's the JSON response:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(1, 6)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [1] and [6] splits the graph into two subgraphs: one containing nodes {0, 2, 3, 4} and the other containing nodes {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}."
}
```
