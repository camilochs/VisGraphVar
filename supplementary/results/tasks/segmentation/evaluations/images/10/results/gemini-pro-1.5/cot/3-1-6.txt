  "cut_edge": "(1, 6)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 6 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], forming a cycle of length 5. The second subgraph contains nodes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], forming a cycle of length 5.  This is a cut edge because there is no other path between the two cycles formed by these sets of nodes. Removing any other edge would leave the graph connected because cycle graphs have redundant paths."
