Given the graph, I will analyze it to identify the cut edge (bridge), which is an edge whose removal would increase the number of connected components.

The graph is as follows:
```
        (9)—
       /   \
 (8)---(5)---(3)
       \   /
        (2)
       /   \
 (7)---(6)---(1)—(4)
       /
      (0)
```

From the graph, it can be observed that the edge connecting nodes 2 and 9 is a cut edge. Removing this edge will split the graph into two separate subgraphs.

Here is the JSON representation of the analysis:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(2, 9)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 2 and 9 splits the graph into two subgraphs: one consisting of nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4, and the other consisting of nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9."
}
```
