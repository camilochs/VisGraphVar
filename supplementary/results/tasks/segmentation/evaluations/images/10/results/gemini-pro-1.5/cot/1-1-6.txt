  "cut_edge": "(1, 6)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 6 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, forming a five-node connected component.  The second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, forming another five-node connected component. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between the two resulting subgraphs after the edge (1, 6) is removed."
