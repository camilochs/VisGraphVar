  "cut_edge": "(4, 7)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 4 and 7 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, forming a small, somewhat circular structure. The second subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, forming a close-knit structure resembling a four-sided polygon with an extra edge. This is a cut edge because there are no alternative paths between these two distinct subgraphs. Removing any other edge would still leave the graph connected overall, making this the sole bridge between the two components."
