The cut edge is identified as the edge between nodes 9 and 8 in the provided graph. Removing this edge leads to the division of the graph into two distinct subgraphs: one containing the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6} and the other set comprising {5, 7, 8, 9}.

**Answer:** 
```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(8, 9)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 8 and 9 splits the graph into two subgraphs: one containing nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6} and the other containing nodes {5, 7, 8, 9}."
