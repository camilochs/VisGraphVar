**Analysis of the Graph Visualization**

The provided graph visualization consists of 9 nodes and 10 edges. To identify the cut edge, we will examine each edge individually to determine its impact on the connectivity of the graph.

**Identifying the Cut Edge**

The cut edge is the edge that connects nodes 5 and 0. Removing this edge would disconnect the graph into two separate subgraphs.

**Resulting Subgraphs**

*   The first subgraph consists of nodes 8, 9, 5, 6, and 7.
*   The second subgraph consists of nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the cut edge is the one between nodes 5 and 0.

**JSON Response**
