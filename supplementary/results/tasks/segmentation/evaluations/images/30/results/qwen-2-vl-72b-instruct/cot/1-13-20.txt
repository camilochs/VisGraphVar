   "cut_edge": "(20, 23)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [20] and [23] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the second subgraph contains nodes [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between the separated components, and removing this edge creates exactly two subgraphs. No other path exists that could keep the components connected."
