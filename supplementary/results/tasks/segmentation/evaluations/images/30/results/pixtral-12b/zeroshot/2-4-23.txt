To determine the cut edge, we need to analyze the graph and identify the edge whose removal will result in the graph being split into two separate subgraphs. A cut edge, often referred to as a bridge, is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components of the graph.

After reviewing the graph, the cut edge is identified as follows:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(21, 22)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [21] and [22] splits the graph into two subgraphs. One subgraph will be the sequence of nodes [21, 14, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 29] forming a circular structure, while the other subgraph will be the remaining nodes ([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28])."
}
```

Removing the edge between nodes 21 and 22 will effectively divide the graph into two disconnected parts as described above.
