   "cut_edge": "(21, 23)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [21] and [23] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 21, 22], while the second subgraph contains nodes [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. This is a cut edge because any alternative path between these components would traverse through other nodes, thereby keeping the graph connected. The removal of this edge ensures that no other connection exists between the two resulting subgraphs."
