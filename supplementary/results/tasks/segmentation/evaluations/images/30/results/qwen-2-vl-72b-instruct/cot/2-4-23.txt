   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [10] and [11] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [11, 12, 13, 14, 2, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 1, 0, 6, 5, 4, 3, 22, 14], while the second subgraph contains nodes [10, 9, 8, 7, 10]. This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between these two components, removing it disconnects the graph into two distinct parts."
