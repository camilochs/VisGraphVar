   "cut_edge": "(6, 7)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 6 and 7 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains the nodes 7 and 8, while the second subgraph contains all other nodes. This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between the two subgraphs, and no other path exists that could keep the components connected."
