**Step 1: Identify the cut edge in the graph**

To identify the cut edge, we need to find the edge that connects two separate subgraphs. In this case, the cut edge is between nodes 3 and 4.

**Step 2: Remove the cut edge and analyze the resulting subgraphs**

When we remove the edge between nodes 3 and 4, the graph splits into two separate subgraphs. Subgraph 1 consists of nodes 1, 2, and 3, while subgraph 2 consists of nodes 4, 5, and 6.

**Step 3: Formulate the answer in JSON format**

Here is the answer in JSON format:

```json
{
    "cut_edge": "(3, 4)",
    "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 3 and 4 splits the graph into two separate subgraphs: Subgraph 1 consists of nodes 1, 2, and 3, while Subgraph 2 consists of nodes 4, 5, and 6."
}
```

**Answer**: The cut edge is between nodes 3 and 4, and removing it splits the graph into two separate subgraphs.
