  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 14 and 20 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 7, 28, 29, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 and the second subgraph contains nodes 14, 21. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two sets of nodes.  Removing any other edge will not disconnect the graph."
