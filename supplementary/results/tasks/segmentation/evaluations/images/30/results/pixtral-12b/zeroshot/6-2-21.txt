Analyzing the provided graph visualization, the cut edge that, when removed, divides the graph into two separate subgraphs is identified as the edge between nodes numbered 12 and 21.

Here is the JSON representation of the analysis:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(12, 21)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 12 and 21 splits the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph consists of nodes [14, 13, 12] connected in a loop and nodes [0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 20]. The second subgraph consists of nodes [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 19, 18, 15, 16, 17]."
}
```
This cut edge effectively partitions the graph into two distinct components as described.
