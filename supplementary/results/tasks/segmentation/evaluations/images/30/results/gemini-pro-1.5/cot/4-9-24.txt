  "cut_edge": "(9, 24)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 9 and 24 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0 through 14, forming a cycle. The second subgraph contains nodes 15 through 29, also forming a cycle.  This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between these two cycles. Removing any other edge would leave the cycle containing that edge intact."
