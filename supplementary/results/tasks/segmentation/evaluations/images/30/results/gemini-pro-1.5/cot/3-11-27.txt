{
  "cut_edge": "(11, 27)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 11 and 27 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0-14, encompassing the larger loop.  The second subgraph contains nodes 15-29, forming the smaller, denser cluster. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two distinct clusters of nodes. Removing any other edge would either maintain connectivity within the existing larger or smaller structure or create more than two subgraphs by fragmenting one of the existing components."
