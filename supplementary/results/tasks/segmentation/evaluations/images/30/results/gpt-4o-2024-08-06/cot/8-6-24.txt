    "cut_edge": "(24, 25)",
    "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 24 and 25 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0 to 14, which form a cycle, while the second subgraph contains nodes 15 to 29, which also form a cycle. This is a cut edge because it is the only direct connection between these two cycles, and removing it disconnects the graph into exactly two components with no alternative paths existing between the separated parts."
