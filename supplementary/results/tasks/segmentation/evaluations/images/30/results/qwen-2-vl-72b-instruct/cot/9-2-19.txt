   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [1] and [2] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0-14] and the second subgraph contains nodes [15-29]. This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between the two components. No other path exists that could keep the components connected."
