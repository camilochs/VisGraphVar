   "cut_edge": "(9, 24)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [9] and [24] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0 to 14, which form a connected cycle, while the second subgraph contains nodes 15 to 29, which also form a separate connected cycle. This is a cut edge because removing it disconnects the two cycles, with no alternative paths to keep them connected."
