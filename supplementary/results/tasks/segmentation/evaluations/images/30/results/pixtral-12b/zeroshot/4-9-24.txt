To identify the cut edge of the graph, we need to determine the edge whose removal would disconnect the graph into two separate subgraphs. By analyzing the graph, we can see that the edge between node 9 and node 10 is a cut edge.

Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(9, 10)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [9] and [10] splits the graph into two subgraphs. One subgraph contains nodes 0 to 9 and another subgraph contains nodes 11 to 29."
}
```
