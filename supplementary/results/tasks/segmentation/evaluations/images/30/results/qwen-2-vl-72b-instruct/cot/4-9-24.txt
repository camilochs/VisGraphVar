   "cut_edge": "(9, 24)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [9] and [24] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes from [0] to [14] forming a closed loop. The second subgraph contains nodes from [15] to [29], also forming a closed loop. This is a cut edge because there are no alternative paths between these two components, and removing this edge creates exactly two subgraphs. Each subgraph remains internally connected without any connections between them."
