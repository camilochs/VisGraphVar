  "cut_edge": "(2, 19)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 2 and 19 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0-14, while the second subgraph contains nodes 15-29. This is a cut edge because there are no other paths connecting these two sets of nodes, and removing it creates exactly two disconnected components."
