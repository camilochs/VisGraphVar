   "cut_edge": "(11, 21)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [11] and [21] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0] to [14], representing the top-right portion of the graph, while the second subgraph contains nodes [15] to [29], representing the bottom-left portion of the graph. This is a cut edge because it is the only connection between the top-right and bottom-left sections of the graph. Removing this edge ensures that there is no alternative path connecting these two subgraphs."
