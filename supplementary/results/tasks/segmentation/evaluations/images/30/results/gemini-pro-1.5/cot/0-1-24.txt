  "cut_edge": "(1, 24)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 24 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 2 through 9, forming a path graph.  The second subgraph contains nodes 0, 10 through 23, and 24 through 29, forming the larger, more complex component including two cycles. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between nodes 1 and 24 after their direct connection is removed, and the removal creates two distinct connected components."
