   "cut_edge": "(14, 25)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [14] and [25] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The second subgraph contains nodes [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. This is a cut edge because it is the only edge connecting the two subgraphs, and removing it ensures no other path exists between them."
