  "cut_edge": "(21, 22)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 21 and 22 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0-21, forming a circular structure with interconnected nodes. The second subgraph contains nodes 22-29, also forming a circular structure.  This is a cut edge because it is the sole connection between these two otherwise independent circular components.  There are no alternative paths between the two resulting subgraphs once edge (21, 22) is removed."
