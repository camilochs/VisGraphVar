  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 4 and 22 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 0, 1, 2, 3, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 28, 29, 27, 26, 25, 24, and 23, while the second subgraph contains only node 4.  This is a cut edge because there is no other path between node 4 and the rest of the graph. Removing any other edge would not disconnect any nodes from the rest of the graph. "
