**Step 1: Identify the cut edge**

The given graph poses a challenge in identifying whether there are any cut edges. However, upon further examination, we notice that vertex 7 isn't directly connected to any outgoing edges. To zero in directly on the solution we will examine whether there are any outgoing edges from node 1 and 7 that might indirectly connect with the other nodes.

The sole outgoing edges connected to node 1 are nodes 19 and 20. Both of nodes 19 and 20 don't have their own outgoing edges, and therefore, form disconnected vertices from the rest of the vertices present in the undirected graph.



**Step 2: Explain the implication of the identified edge**

In summary, removing the edge between nodes 1 and 2 will result in the split of the graph into two subgraphs, namely: 
Subgraph 1: Having node 1, 19, 20 
Subgraph 2: Having nodes 2 to 30 (excluding nodes 1, 19, and 20).

**Step 3: Summarize your findings in the requested JSON format**

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(1, 2)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [1] and [2] splits the graph into two subgraphs: (1, 19, 20), and (2 through node 30)."
}
