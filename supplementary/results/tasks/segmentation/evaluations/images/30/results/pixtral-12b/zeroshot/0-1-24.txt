Based on a careful analysis of the given graph, the cut edge, or bridge, is identified as the edge between nodes 24 and 1. Removing this edge will divide the graph into two separate subgraphs.

Here is the detailed information in the required JSON format:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(24, 1)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 24 and 1 splits the graph into two subgraphs. One subgraph will contain nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 24. The other subgraph will contain nodes 0, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29."
}
