After analyzing the graph, it is clear that the edge connecting nodes 11 and 27 acts as the cut edge. Removing this edge will split the graph into two separate subgraphs.

Here is the JSON format:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(11, 27)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 11 and 27 splits the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph includes the nodes [14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]. The second subgraph includes the nodes [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 22, 23, 21, 29, 20, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]."
}
```
