{
  "cut_edge": "(24, 6)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 24 and 6 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0-5 and 7-14, forming a smaller cycle. The second subgraph contains nodes 15-29, forming a larger cycle.  This edge (24,6) is the cut edge because it is the only connection between these two cycles. Removing any other edge would either not disconnect the graph or split it into more than two components."
