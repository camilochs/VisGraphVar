**Cut Edge Identification and Analysis**

To identify the cut edge in the graph, we need to examine each edge individually and determine which one, when removed, increases the number of connected components.

Upon analyzing the graph, we find that the edge between nodes 3 and 4 is a cut edge. Removing this edge splits the graph into two separate subgraphs.

**Cut Edge Information**

*   Cut Edge: (3, 4)
*   Analysis: "Removing the edge between nodes [3] and [4] splits the graph into two subgraphs: one containing nodes 0-6 and another containing nodes 7-29."

**JSON Response**

```json
{
  "cut_edge": "(3, 4)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [3] and [4] splits the graph into two subgraphs: one containing nodes 0-6 and another containing nodes 7-29."
}
```

In summary, the cut edge in the graph is the edge between nodes 3 and 4. Removing this edge increases the number of connected components, resulting in two separate subgraphs.
