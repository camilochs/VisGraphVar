The cut edge in the graph visualization divides the graph into two separate subgraphs: one with nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14} and the other with nodes {21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}.

**Answer:**
```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(12, 21)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 12 and 21 splits the graph into two subgraphs: a cycle containing nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14} and a separate subgraph containing nodes {21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}."
}
