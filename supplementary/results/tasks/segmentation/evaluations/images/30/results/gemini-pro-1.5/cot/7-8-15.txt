  "cut_edge": "(15, 8)",
  "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 15 and 8 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0-14, forming a large cycle with some additional edges. The second subgraph contains nodes 15-29, which also has a cyclical structure with additional connections. This is a cut edge because there is no other path between these two distinct groups of nodes, and its removal disconnects the graph into exactly two separate components."
