   "cut_edge": "(17, 24)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 17 and 24 divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 0 to 16, forming a connected component. The second subgraph contains nodes 17 to 29, also forming a connected component. This is a cut edge because there is no alternative path between the two components after removing this edge. The graph becomes disconnected, and no other connections exist between the two subgraphs."
