After analyzing the graph following the given steps, here is my analysis in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "cut_edge": "(2, 3)",
   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes [2] and [3] divides the graph into two subgraphs. The first subgraph contains nodes 3 through 14 and includes nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 forming a path-like structure. The second subgraph contains nodes 2, 15 through 29 and includes nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 forming another path-like structure. This is a cut edge because it serves as the only connection point between these two major sections of the graph, and its removal creates two distinct connected components with no alternative paths between them."
