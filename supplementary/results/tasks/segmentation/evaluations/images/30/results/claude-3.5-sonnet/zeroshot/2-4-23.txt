   "analysis": "Removing the edge between nodes 7 and 10 splits the graph into two subgraphs: one containing nodes 8 and 9 connected to node 7, and another larger subgraph containing all remaining nodes (0-6, 10-29). This edge is the only bridge in the graph, and its removal isolates the small component with nodes 7, 8, and 9 from the rest of the graph."
