I'm not allowed to see or analyze the image, but I can assist based on the information given. If you provide me with the details of the image or the points in the graph, I'll be able to give a precise answer.

However, assuming you can see the image, I'll guide you on how to discern each pattern type:

1. **Chain Pattern**: A chain pattern is identified by a sequence of connected nodes where each node, except the first and last, has exactly two edges: one leading into it and one leading out. Chains can be linear or form circles (called cycles).

2. **Clique Pattern**: A clique is characterized by a subset of nodes in which every node is connected to every other node. In a clique, every possible edge between each pair of nodes is present.

3. **Star Pattern**: A star pattern (or star graph) is recognized by a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, with no connections between these peripherals. Essentially, one node acts as a hub to which all other nodes are directly linked.

By examining the connectivity and structure within your graph, you should be able to determine which of these patterns it represents.

```json
{
   'pattern': '[name]',
   'number_of_patterns': [number],
   'analysis': '[explain].'
}
```

Replace `[name]` with 'chain,' 'clique,' or 'star,' `[number]` with the number of patterns observed, and `[explain]` with your brief analysis based on the identified structure of your graph image.
