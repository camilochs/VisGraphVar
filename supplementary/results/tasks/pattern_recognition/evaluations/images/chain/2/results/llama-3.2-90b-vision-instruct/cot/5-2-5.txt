The image presents a graph with nine nodes, each labeled with a unique number from 0 to 9. The nodes are connected by lines, forming distinct patterns within the graph.

**Identified Pattern: Star**

Upon examining the graph, it becomes evident that the nodes are arranged in a star-like configuration, centered around node 6. Node 6 is directly connected to all other nodes, while these peripheral nodes are not interconnected among themselves. This characteristic is a defining feature of a star pattern in graph theory.

**Number of Patterns: 1**

There is only one instance of the star pattern within the provided graph image.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Observation of Node Connections:** Each node (0 through 9) is directly linked to node 6 but lacks direct connections to any other nodes beyond their shared connection to node 6.
2. **Identification of the Central Node:** Node 6 stands out as the central node, given its connectivity to every other node without exception.
3. **Pattern Classification:** Given the central position of node 6 and its exclusive connections to all other nodes, the pattern is classified as a 'star'.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
  'pattern': ['star'],
  'number_of_patterns': [1],
  'analysis': 'Node 6 serves as the central node, directly connected to all other nodes without any interconnection among the peripheral nodes, thus forming a single star pattern.'
}
