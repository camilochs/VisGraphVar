Unfortunately, I am unable to analyze the graph image as no image has been provided. However, I can provide a response based on a hypothetical graph image:

**Answer:** 

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 1,
   'analysis': 'Upon examining the structure, I observed that there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes, where the central node is directly connected to all other nodes, but the peripheral nodes are not directly connected to each other. This indicates a star pattern. I counted one instance of this pattern type in the graph.'
}
```

Please note that this response is purely hypothetical and not based on any actual graph image.
