Firstly, there is a linear "chain" pattern on the left comprising five vertices connected sequentially from vertex 5 to vertex 9, illustrating a simple one-dimensional path. Secondly, on the right, there is a "star" pattern with four vertices (1, 2, 3, and 4) where all vertices converge at vertex 1, illustrating a central vertex with multiple neighboring vertices.'
