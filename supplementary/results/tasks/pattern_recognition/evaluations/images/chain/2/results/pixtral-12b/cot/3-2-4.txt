   "analysis": "To identify the pattern type in the given graph, I followed these steps:\n1. Observing the structure, I identified two linear sequences of nodes.\n2. Each sequence features nodes directly connected in series, indicating a sequential or linear arrangement. This reflects the characteristics of a 'chain' pattern.\n3. I didn't find clusters in which all nodes are fully interconnected (as would be the case for a 'clique') or a central node with peripheral nodes (common for a 'star').\n4. Therefore, there are two distinct linear patterns or 'chains' in the graph."
