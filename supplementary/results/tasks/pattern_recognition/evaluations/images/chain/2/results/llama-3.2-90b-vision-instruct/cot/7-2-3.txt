Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to visually analyze the graph image as it is not provided in the text prompt. However, I can guide you through the steps to identify the pattern type in a graph image.

To analyze the graph image, follow these steps:

1. Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.
2. Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').
3. Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.

Since I cannot visually analyze the graph image, I cannot provide the final answer in the JSON format. However, I can provide a sample JSON response for demonstration purposes only:

```json
{
  'pattern': ['chain'],
  'number_of_patterns': [2],
  'analysis': 'The graph image contains two distinct clusters, each with nodes interconnected in a continuous sequence, resembling a chain pattern.'
}
```

Please note that this is a sample response and may not accurately describe the actual graph image.
