   "analysis": "The graph shows two distinct chain patterns. The first chain consists of nodes 0-1-2-3 connected in a linear sequence, and the second chain consists of nodes 7-6-5-4 also connected linearly. Each node in both chains is connected to exactly two other nodes (except for the end nodes which connect to only one node), forming a sequential path. There are no central nodes with multiple connections (ruling out star pattern) and no fully interconnected groups (ruling out clique pattern). The linear arrangement and sequential connections clearly indicate these are chain patterns."
