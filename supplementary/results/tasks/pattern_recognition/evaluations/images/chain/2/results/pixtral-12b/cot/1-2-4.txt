                1. In the upper sequence, the nodes (4-5-6-7) are connected in a linear manner.
                2. In the lower sequence, the nodes (0-1-2-3) are also connected linearly. 
                Both sequences satisfy the requirement of a 'chain' pattern where each node is connected to only two other nodes (except the endpoints)."
