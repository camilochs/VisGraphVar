**Pattern Analysis**

Unfortunately, I am unable to analyze an image as text based systems cannot provide that functionality.

However, I can provide a general analysis of types of patterns that could appear on a graph and thus how to identify what appears in your image. 'chain,' 'clique,' or 'star' graphs are common graph theories in mathematics and computer science. Here are their characteristics:
- A 'chain,' also known as 'path,' is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, with no vertex connected to more than two others. It represents a linear or sequential relationship between vertices.
- A 'clique,' on the other hand, is a subset of vertices in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. In other words, it's a fully connected subgraph where every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex.  
- A 'star,' is a graph consisting of a central vertex connected to all other vertices, with no other edges between the non-central vertices. This represents a hub-and-spoke structure where the central vertex has high connectivity.

Without the ability to see the graph image provided, I couldn't determine which type of pattern it contains. But if you're looking at your graph, compare its structure against these definitions:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1, 1, 1],
   'analysis': 'Analyze the connectivity of vertices and the arrangement of edges in the graph to identify the patterns.'
}
```
This is a simple JSON file that serves as a placeholder until I can use the graph image to complete analysis of its content.
