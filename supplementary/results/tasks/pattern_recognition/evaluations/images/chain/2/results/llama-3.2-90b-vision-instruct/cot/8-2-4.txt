Based on the graph image, I observe that the nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence without isolated nodes. Therefore, I identify the pattern type as 'chain'. There are 2 instances of this pattern type, as there are two separate chains of nodes.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'The graph image shows two separate chains of nodes, where each node is connected to its neighbors in a linear sequence.'
}
```
