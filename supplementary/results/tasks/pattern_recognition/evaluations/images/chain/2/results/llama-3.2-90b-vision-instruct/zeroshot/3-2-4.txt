```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique', 'chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1, 3],
   'analysis': 'A clique is indicated by nodes 4, 7 that are directly connected each other, but are also connected to the majority of the graph. The chain pattern is indicated by nodes [2, 1, 0], [5, 6], and [3] where each node has fewer connections than a clique, but they follow a linear sequence.'
