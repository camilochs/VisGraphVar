**Pattern Identification**

To identify the type of pattern in the graph, we need to analyze its structure.

*   The graph consists of a sequence of connected nodes, where each node is directly connected to its preceding and succeeding nodes.
*   There are no nodes that have edges connecting them to all other nodes.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the graph represents a chain pattern.

**Conclusion**

The final answer is:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": [2],
   "analysis": "The graph shows sequential connections between nodes without any node connected to all others."
}
```
