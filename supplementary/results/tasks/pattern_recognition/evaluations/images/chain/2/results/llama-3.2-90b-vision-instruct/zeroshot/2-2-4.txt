**Step 1: Identify the pattern types**

To determine the type of pattern in the graph, we need to understand what each pattern looks like:

-   A chain pattern is a sequence of nodes where each node is connected to its neighbor.
-   A clique pattern is a group of nodes where each node is connected to every other node.
-   A star pattern is a group of nodes where one node is connected to all other nodes.

**Step 2: Analyze the graph**

Looking at the graph, we can see that it consists of two separate groups of nodes. The first group has nodes labeled 4, 5, 6, and 7, connected in a sequence. The second group has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3, also connected in a sequence.

**Step 3: Determine the pattern type**

Based on the analysis, both groups form a chain pattern because each node is connected to its neighbor.

**Conclusion**

*   Pattern: chain
*   Number of patterns: 2
*   Analysis: The graph contains two separate chains of nodes, each connected in a sequence.

**Final answer**

```json
{
    "pattern": ["chain"],
    "number_of_patterns": 2,
    "analysis": "The graph contains two separate chains of nodes, each connected in a sequence."
