**Pattern Identification**

To identify the pattern type, we will follow the steps outlined:

1. **Observe the Structure**: The graph consists of two distinct clusters or groups of interconnected nodes.

2. **Determine Pattern Type**:
   - For a 'chain,' nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence. However, both clusters have branches and are not linear.
   - For a 'clique,' all nodes within a cluster are fully interconnected. This is not the case in either cluster.
   - For a 'star,' there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes. The top cluster resembles this pattern, with Node 3 as the central node, and the bottom cluster doesn't form a clear star pattern due to its connectivity.

3. **Count Instances**: We identify one cluster resembling a 'star' pattern. The bottom cluster does not fit any of the specified patterns clearly.

**Conclusion**

Given the observations:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 1,
   'analysis': 'The top cluster of the graph resembles a star pattern with node 3 at the center, directly connected to nodes 1 and 2. This configuration aligns with the definition of a star pattern where a central node connects to outer nodes.'
}
```
