**Pattern Detection in the Given Graph**

To determine the pattern type in the provided graph, let's examine the structure:

*   The graph consists of a sequence of nodes that are connected in a linear fashion.
*   Each node has an edge connecting it to the next and previous node, except for the first and last nodes.
*   There is no indication of a densely connected subgraph (clique) or a central node connected to all other nodes (star).

Given these characteristics, the graph follows a **chain pattern**. This pattern is identified by its linear sequence of nodes where each node is connected to its immediate predecessor and successor, forming a continuous chain without any branches or cycles.

**Conclusion:**

```json
{
  "pattern": ["chain"],
  "number_of_patterns": 1,
  "analysis": "The graph presents a linear sequence of nodes connected one after another, indicative of a chain pattern with no evidence of a clique or star pattern."
}
```

This conclusion is based on the visual examination of the graph's structure, which clearly aligns with the definition of a chain pattern.
