When analyzing the graph structure, we observe two disconnected chains arbitrarily connected. To arrive at this value, we follow the connections between adjacent vertices that are arranged linearly.

Consequently, the total number of patterns identified is 2, and a detailed explanation for the patterns' number and type is provided in the following JSON format:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "The graph features two disconnected chains arbitrarily connected."
}
```

The final answer is as provided in the JSON format.
