**Pattern Analysis**

Based on the provided graph image, we can identify two distinct patterns: a chain and a star.

**Chain Pattern**

A chain pattern is characterized by a sequence of nodes connected in a linear fashion, where each node has only one neighbor.

*   **Chain Example:**
    *   Nodes 3, 2, and 1 form a chain.
    *   Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 1.
*   **Chain Count:**
    *   There are two chains in the graph image, one with nodes 3, 2, and 1 and another smaller chain with nodes 6 and 7.

**Star Pattern**

A star pattern is characterized by a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, with no connections between the peripheral nodes.

*   **Star Example:**
    *   Node 5 forms a star pattern by being connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
*   **Star Count:**
    *   There is one star pattern in the graph image, centered around node 5.

**Pattern Count**

There are two chain patterns and one star pattern in the graph image.

**JSON Response**

```json
{
    "pattern": ["chain", "star"],
    "number_of_patterns": [2, 1],
    "analysis": "The graph image contains two chain patterns and one star pattern. The chain patterns are formed by nodes 3, 2, and 1, as well as nodes 6 and 7. The star pattern is centered around node 5, which is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7."
}
```

In summary, the graph image exhibits both chain and star patterns, with two instances of the former and one instance of the latter.
