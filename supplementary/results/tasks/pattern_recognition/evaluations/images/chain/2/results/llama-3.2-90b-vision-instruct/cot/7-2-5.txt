**Pattern Identification**

To identify the pattern in the graph, we follow these steps:

1. **Observe the Structure**: The graph consists of a series of connected nodes. Each node is labeled with a number and is directly connected to its adjacent nodes.

2. **Identify Clusters or Connections**: There are no clusters or groups of nodes that are not connected to the rest of the graph. The nodes form a continuous sequence where each node (except the first and last) is connected to two other nodes.

3. **Determine the Pattern Type**:
   - **Chain**: A chain pattern would have nodes connected in a sequence but does not necessarily imply branching or cycles. The given graph fits this description as each node is part of a single sequence without any isolated subgroups or fully interlinked sets of nodes.
   - **Clique**: A clique would involve all nodes being interconnected which is not the case here.
   - **Star**: A star pattern would have a central node connected to all peripheral nodes, which is also not observed.

4. **Count Instances**: Given the linear sequence without branching or fully interconnected subsets, there is **1** instance of a pattern that matches the description of a chain.

**Conclusion**:

Based on the analysis, the identified pattern is a **chain** because the nodes form a continuous, non-branching sequence. There is **1** chain in the graph. The graph does not display characteristics of a clique or a star due to its linear, non-fully interconnected structure and absence of central nodes with peripheral connections.
