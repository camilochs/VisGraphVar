**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the graph, let's analyze its features:

*   The graph consists of a series of nodes connected by edges.
*   Each node has a unique number.
*   The edges connect consecutive nodes, forming a linear structure.
*   There are no branches or multiple connections between nodes.

Given these characteristics, the pattern resembles a chain where each node is connected to the next one in a sequence, without any node being connected to more than two others (except for the start and end nodes, which have only one connection). This structure is typical of a chain or path in graph theory.

**Conclusion**

```json
{
   'pattern': 'chain',
   'number_of_patterns': 1,
   'analysis': 'The graph exhibits a linear structure with nodes connected sequentially, characteristic of a chain pattern.'
}
```

In conclusion, the graph displays a single chain-like pattern with nodes arranged in a sequence and connected to their immediate predecessors and successors, barring the endpoints.
