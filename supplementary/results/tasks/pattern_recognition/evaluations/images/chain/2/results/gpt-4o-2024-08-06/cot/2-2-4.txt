   "analysis": "There are two distinct linear sequences of nodes. The first chain is composed of nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7. Each node is connected sequentially with no branching. The second chain is composed of nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, also connected in a linear sequence. There are no fully interconnected nodes or central nodes with peripheries, indicating that the pattern type is 'chain' with two instances."
