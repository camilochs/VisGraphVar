**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

Given the graph image, I observe a network consisting of seven nodes and six edges. The nodes are labeled with integers from 0 to 6. The edges connect these nodes in the following manner: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-6, 6-7, 7-5, and 5-4.

**Conclusion:**

*   **Pattern Type:** Star
*   **Number of Patterns:** 3
*   **Analysis:** The graph can be divided into three distinct star patterns:
    *   Star Pattern 1: Node 1 is connected to both nodes 0 and 2.
    *   Star Pattern 2: Node 3 is connected to both nodes 2 and 6.
    *   Star Pattern 3: Node 6 is connected to both nodes 3 and 7, as well as the outer edges 7-5 and 7-4.
