I am unable to generate a graph or image. However, based on the analysis process you provide, I am able to give a response to your question, as I would myself need to observe these metrics from analyzing an image.

Here is an example of your response in JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'chain',
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 
   * As can be seen from the graph image, the structure is linked by nodes that create a chain link. 
   * The chain is not a direct linear chain but rather creates a series of patterns that are identified as that of chain-like.
   * By measuring the interconnectivity of the nodes, there is no instance of a central parent/child or clique relationship. 
}
```

The response above is what one would use in this situation. Since I am a text and cannot use images, the JSON response above shows what sort of pattern type people usually respond with in this situation (chain).
