Based on the provided graph image, here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'The graph contains two distinct patterns: a linear sequence (chain) and a star-like formation. The first pattern is a linear chain consisting of four nodes (4, 5, 6, 7) connected sequentially. The second pattern is a star-shaped structure centered around node 0, with nodes 1, 2, and 3 connected to it. This indicates a central node (0) with multiple direct connections (3 edges).'
