**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph image, we will follow the specified steps:

1. **Identify distinct clusters, groups, or links**: The graph consists of two separate parts. On the left side, there is a node labeled "0" connected to another node labeled "1", which in turn is connected to a node labeled "2". This forms a sequence of three nodes. On the right side, there is a node labeled "3" connected to another node labeled "4", and then "4" is connected to a node labeled "5". This also forms a sequence of three nodes but is separate from the first sequence.

2. **Determine the pattern type**:
   - A 'chain' would represent a continuous sequence where each node (except the first and last) is connected to exactly two other nodes. Both groups in the image fit this description as they consist of linear sequences of nodes.
   - A 'clique' is defined by all nodes being directly connected to every other node, which does not apply here since the nodes are connected in sequences, not fully interlinked.
   - A 'star' would have one central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, which is not the case in this image as each node is part of a linear sequence.

3. **Count the instances of each identified pattern**: There are two instances of linear sequences (chains) in the image.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the identified pattern type is a 'chain' because both groups of nodes form linear sequences where each node (except the first and last) connects two others.
