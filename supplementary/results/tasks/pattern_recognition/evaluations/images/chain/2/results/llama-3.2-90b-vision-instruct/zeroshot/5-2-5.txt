**Graph Pattern Analysis**

To analyze the given graph image and identify the type of pattern it contains, we need to examine its structure and connectivity.

**Step 1: Graph Structure Examination**

* The graph consists of several nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
* Each node has a unique identifier, ranging from 0 to 9.
* The edges connect the nodes in a specific manner.

**Step 2: Pattern Recognition**

* A "chain" pattern involves a sequence of nodes connected linearly without any branching or loops.
* A "clique" pattern involves a group of nodes where every node is directly connected to every other node within the group.
* A "star" pattern involves a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, with no connections between the peripheral nodes.

**Step 3: Pattern Identification**

Upon examining the graph structure, we notice that node 6 is connected to multiple nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9), but these peripheral nodes are not interconnected with each other. This characteristic aligns with the definition of a "star" pattern.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph contains a single "star" pattern centered around node 6.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
  "pattern": ["star"],
  "number_of_patterns": [1],
  "analysis": "Node 6 is connected to multiple nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) without any interconnections between the peripheral nodes, indicating a 'star' pattern."
