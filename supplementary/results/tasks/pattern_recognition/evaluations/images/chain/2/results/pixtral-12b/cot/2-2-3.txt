The graph consists of two distinct clusters of nodes. Let's analyze these clusters step by step:

1. Observing the structure:
   - There is a vertical chain of three connected nodes labeled 0, 1, and 2.
   - There is a triangular group of three connected nodes labeled 3, 4, and 5, forming a small triangle.

2. Determining the pattern type:
   - The first cluster (0, 1, 2) forms a "chain" as the nodes are sequentially connected.
   - The second cluster (3, 4, 5) forms a "clique" as all nodes are fully interconnected with each other.

3. Counting instances:
   - One "chain" pattern.
   - One "clique" pattern.

4. Explanation:
   - The first cluster (0, 1, 2) follows the pattern of a "chain," where the nodes are connected sequentially without branching.
   - The second cluster (3, 4, 5) forms a "clique," where every node is connected to every other node in the subset.
