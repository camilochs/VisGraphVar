This is an impossible task without the actual image being analyzed. However, based on a hypothetical image with several interconnected nodes and distinct clusters of densely connected nodes, here is one possible outcome:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'There appear to be three subgraphs, each of which consists of a number of interconnected nodes, each linked with every other node within their respective pattern.'
}
```

Without the graph image provided, we cannot identify the exact configurations, the distributions, or interconnectivity of the associated nodesâ€™ clusters, groups, or links, nor can we determine specifically how many instances of each pattern type appear within it. Further it is impossible to provide a meaningful analysis without this kind of information being present.  

Please note that the answer given here serves only as one possible answer and may not apply in all cases. For accurate identification, a visual analysis of the actual image would be required.
