The graph image consists of two disconnected clusters of nodes. Let's analyze the structure step by step:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters**:
   - The graph has two separate sequences of nodes.

2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected**:
   - The first sequence (left side) includes the nodes labeled 0, 1, and 2 connected linearly.
   - The second sequence (right side) includes the nodes labeled 3, 4, and 5 connected linearly.

3. **Count the number of instances of each identified pattern**:
   - There are two linear arrangements of nodes.

4. **Explanation**:
   - Each linear arrangement of nodes from one endpoint to the other (0->1->2 and 3->4->5) represents a "chain" pattern.
   - There are no fully interconnected or clique patterns where all nodes are connected to each other within the same group.
   - There are no central nodes with surrounding peripheral nodes as seen in star patterns.

Following this analysis, both sequences fit the "chain" pattern.

   'pattern': ['chain', 'chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': "The graph consists of two distinct clusters each having a linear arrangement of nodes starting from one node and connecting to subsequent nodes sequentially. These linear structures from one end to the other are known as 'chain' patterns. Each sequence of connected nodes (0-1-2 and 3-4-5) qualifies as a 'chain' pattern."
