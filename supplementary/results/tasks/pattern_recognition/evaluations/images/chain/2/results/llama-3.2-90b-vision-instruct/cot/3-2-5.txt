**Analysis of the Graph Image**

**Step 1: Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**

The graph image is divided into two distinct parts:

*   A chain-like structure with nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
*   A chain-like structure with nodes labeled 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

**Step 2: Determine the Pattern Type**

Based on the layout, both parts resemble a chain pattern, where each node is connected to its adjacent nodes in a continuous sequence.

**Step 3: Count Instances of Each Identified Pattern**

There are two instances of the chain pattern.

**Step 4: Explain Reasoning**

The chain pattern is identified due to the sequential connection of nodes without any central node or fully interconnected structure. This pattern is evident in both parts of the graph.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the pattern type in the graph image is a chain, with two instances of this pattern present.

**Final Answer**
