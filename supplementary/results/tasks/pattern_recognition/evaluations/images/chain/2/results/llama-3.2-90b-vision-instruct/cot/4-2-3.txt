The graph can be analyzed as follows:

* **Step 1: Identify Clusters, Groups, or Links**
	+ Upon visual inspection, the graph reveals two distinct clusters or groups of connected nodes.
	+ The first group consists of nodes labeled 0, 1, and 2, forming a small cluster where each node is directly connected to one other node, resembling a chain or sequential link.
	+ The second group includes nodes labeled 3, 4, and 5, which are also interconnected in a similar fashion, indicating another chain or sequential link within this subset of nodes.

* **Step 2: Determine the Interc مهندevity of Nodes**
	+ Within each group, nodes are directly connected to each other in a linear sequence, without any branching or indications of full interconnectivity as seen in cliques or central nodes indicative of stars.
	+ There are no isolated nodes that are not part of any group or linkage.

* **Step 3: Count Pattern Instances**
	+ Two instances of the chain pattern are observed: one involving nodes 0, 1, and 2, and another involving nodes 3, 4, and 5.

* **Step 4: Explain the Reasoning**
	+ The presence of two distinct, linearly connected sets of nodes, with no indication of full interconnectivity (clique) or a central node with peripheral connections (star), supports the classification of the pattern in the graph as "chain".
	+ This conclusion is based on the sequential arrangement of nodes within each group and the absence of complex interconnections beyond these chains.

Therefore, the identified pattern type is "chain," with two instances observed in the graph.
