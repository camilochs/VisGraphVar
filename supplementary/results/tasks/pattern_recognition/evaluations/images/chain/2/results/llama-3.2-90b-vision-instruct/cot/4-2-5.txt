**Pattern Identification and Analysis**

Following the provided steps to analyze the graph, I observe:

*   The graph consists of two separate subgraphs, which are not connected by any edges.
*   Within each subgraph, nodes are interconnected without any isolated nodes. This suggests that both subgraphs are fully interconnected, meeting the criteria for a 'clique' pattern.
*   Upon closer inspection, it is evident that each subgraph represents an independent 'clique' structure.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the observed structure and relationships among nodes, I conclude that the graph contains two distinct 'clique' patterns.

**JSON Response:**

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "The graph is divided into two subgraphs, each representing a fully interconnected clique pattern with no isolated nodes. This layout and interconnection of nodes justify the identification of two 'clique' patterns in the graph."
}
```
