**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To analyze the graph pattern, we need to observe its structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links. The graph consists of two groups of nodes: one with nodes labeled 0, 1, and 2, and another with nodes labeled 3, 4, and 5.

Upon examining the structure, we notice that each group forms a triangle where every node is connected to every other node within the same group. This indicates that both groups represent cliques since all nodes within each group are fully interconnected, with no isolated nodes.

Therefore, the identified pattern type is a 'clique,' as both our graph's node groups form fully interconnected networks without any isolated nodes. 

The final answer is:

```json
{
  "pattern": ["clique"],
  "number_of_patterns": 2,
  "analysis": "Both our graph's node groups form fully interconnected networks without any isolated nodes."
}
```

This analysis confirms that the graph consists of two cliques.
