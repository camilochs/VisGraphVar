The graph in the image displays a chain pattern, characterized by a sequence of connected nodes with no branches or cycles.

**Key Features:**

* Each node is connected to only two adjacent nodes.
* The graph forms a single, unbroken chain.

**Result:** The graph contains **1** chain pattern, with an analysis explaining the features that led to this conclusion.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1],
   'analysis': 'The graph forms a single, unbroken sequence of connected nodes with no branches or cycles, indicating a chain pattern.'
}
