Based on the image, the graph consists of one clique and no star or chain instances.

**Pattern Type: Clique**

* The graph is fully connected, with a link (edge) between every pair of nodes.
* There are no isolated or peripheral nodes, with all nodes being interconnected.
* Since the graph is fully connected and contains no isolated or peripheral nodes, it is classified as a clique.

**Number of Patterns: Clique (1 instance)**

* There is only one instance of a clique in the graph.

**Analysis:**

The graph's structure can be analyzed as follows:
* Nodes 1 and 2 form one group, with a link between them.
* Nodes 3, 4, and 5 form another group, with a link between them.
* There are also links between nodes 1 and 3, nodes 1 and 5, nodes 2 and 3, nodes 2 and 4, and nodes 2 and 5.
* Each node is connected to every other node, resulting in a fully connected graph, which is the defining characteristic of a clique.
