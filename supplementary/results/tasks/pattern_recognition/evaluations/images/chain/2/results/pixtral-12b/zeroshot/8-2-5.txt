The graph in the image contains multiple connected components. Let's analyze each component to identify the patterns.

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1, 1],
   'analysis': "The graph contains two distinct components. The first component on the left is a 'chain' pattern, where nodes are connected sequentially from node 0 to node 4. The second component on the right is a 'star' pattern, where node 7 acts as the central node connected to nodes 6, 5, 8, and 9. Each component demonstrates a distinct pattern typically associated with graph theory."
