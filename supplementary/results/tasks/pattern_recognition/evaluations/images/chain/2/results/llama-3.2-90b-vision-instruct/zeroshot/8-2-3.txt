**Understanding the Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern in the given graph, let's analyze the connections between nodes.

* Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
* Node 1 is only connected to node 0.
* Node 2 is only connected to node 0.
* Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
* Node 4 is only connected to node 3.
* Node 5 is only connected to node 3.

**Analyzing the Connections**

From the connections, we can see that nodes 1 and 2 are only connected to node 0, and nodes 4 and 5 are only connected to node 3. This indicates that nodes 0 and 3 are central to their respective groups of nodes, with all other nodes connected directly to them.

**Determining the Pattern Type**

Given the connections, we observe that the graph consists of two separate star-like structures centered around nodes 0 and 3. Each of these structures has one central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. This configuration matches the definition of a 'star' pattern, where a central node is connected to multiple edge nodes.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph contains two instances of the 'star' pattern.

**Answer**: ```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'Two separate "star" patterns are identified, each centered around a node connected to multiple other nodes without direct connections between those other nodes, except through the central node.'
}
```
