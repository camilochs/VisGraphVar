    \
   2. Upon further inspection, nodes are interconnected in a linear sequence without any branching, representing a chain-like communication structure\
    \
   3. The top segment has nodes labeled 0 through 4, all connected consecutively. The bottom segment includes nodes labeled 5 through 9, similarly connected consecutively.\
    \
   4. Thus, each segment forms a 'chain' and there are two such chain patterns in the graph."
