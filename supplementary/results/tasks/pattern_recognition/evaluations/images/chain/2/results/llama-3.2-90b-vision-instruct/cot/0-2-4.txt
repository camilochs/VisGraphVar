**Pattern Identification**

To determine the pattern type in the graph image, we follow these steps:

1. **Observe the Structure**: The graph consists of two distinct groups of nodes: one on the left and one on the right. Each group has interconnected nodes.

2. **Identify the Pattern Type**: In both groups, the nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence. There is no central node with surrounding peripheral nodes or fully interconnected nodes without isolated ones.

3. **Count Instances**: There are 2 instances where nodes form a continuous sequence.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the layout and relationships among nodes, the identified pattern type is a 'chain'. 

**Answer**

```json
{
    'pattern': ['chain'],
    'number_of_patterns': 2,
    'analysis': 'The graph image contains two groups of nodes, each forming a continuous sequence without any central node or fully interconnected structure.'
}
