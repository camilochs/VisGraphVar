**Step 1: Analyze the Structure**

To identify the pattern type in the given graph, we need to closely examine the connections between the nodes. We are looking for specific arrangements such as a chain (a continuous link between nodes), a clique (where every node is connected to every other node), or a star pattern (where all peripheral nodes connect to a single central node).

**Step 2: Identify Patterns**

- From the description of the graph, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are individually connected linearly: from node 0 to 1, then to 2, followed by a direct link from 3 to 4 and another direct link from 4 to 5. There are no indications that these sequences form complete interconnected groups (cliques) or that any of these nodes act as a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes in a star pattern.

- The description clearly outlines two separate sequences or paths: one from 0 to 2 (0-1-2) and another from 3 to 5 (3-4-5). These sequences represent chains because they consist of nodes linked one after another.

**Step 3: Count Instances of Each Pattern**

- Since both described paths (0-1-2 and 3-4-5) are separate and each forms a continuous sequence, there are two instances of the chain pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Given the linear path without any mention of complete interconnections among all nodes (which would suggest a clique) or a central node connecting multiple peripherals (indicating a star pattern), the observed graph structure aligns with the definition of a chain pattern. The presence of two such linear sequences confirms that there are indeed two instances of this pattern in the graph.

**Final Answer:**
```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "The graph exhibits two separate linear sequences, one from 0 to 2 (0-1-2) and another from 3 to 5 (3-4-5), indicative of chain patterns with no evidence of a central node in a star pattern or all nodes being interconnected for a clique pattern."
