The graph image displays two distinct clusters, each with a unique pattern. One cluster consists of nodes 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5, connected in a continuous sequence, forming a chain. The other cluster comprises nodes 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, also linked in a continuous sequence, forming another chain.

Therefore, the identified pattern type is a chain, with a total count of 2 instances.
