The graph image contains two distinct sets of nodes: one with nodes labeled 0, 1, and 2; and another with nodes labeled 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Each set shows continuous, sequential links between nodes, forming a chain pattern.

As analyzed:

*   **Pattern Type:** Chain (given that each set of nodes forms an uninterrupted sequence - there are no cliques, clusters without connections to other nodes, or star patterns where a set of nodes radiates from a single, central node).
*   **Count of Patterns:** 2, reflecting the two separate chains observed.
*   **Analysis:** Each chain is distinct and identical in structure (sequential), with each node connected sequentially, thereby fulfilling the criteria for a chain pattern.

This analysis supports the conclusion that the nodes form a chain pattern, which can be expressed in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'chain',
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'Two collections of nodes follow a sequential, uninterrupted pattern - each displays the characteristics of a chain: continuous connections without an omission.'
}
```
