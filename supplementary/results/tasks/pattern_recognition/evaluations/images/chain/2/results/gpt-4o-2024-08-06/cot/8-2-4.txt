   "analysis": "The graph contains two separate instances of sequences where each node is connected sequentially in a line without forming a closed loop. The first chain consists of nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7. The second chain consists of nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. There are no central nodes surrounded by peripheral nodes (as in a 'star'), and there are no completely interconnected groups (as in a 'clique'). Therefore, the pattern identified is a 'chain,' and there are two such patterns in the graph."
