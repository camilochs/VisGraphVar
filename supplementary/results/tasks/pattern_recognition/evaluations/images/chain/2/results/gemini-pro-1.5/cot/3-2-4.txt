  "analysis": "The graph consists of two separate sets of nodes. In each set, the nodes are connected sequentially, forming two distinct chains. The first chain consists of nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, where each node is linked to the next one in the sequence. The second chain consists of nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7, following the same sequential connection pattern. There are no interconnections between the two chains, and no central nodes connecting to all others, ruling out clique and star patterns. Therefore, the pattern is 'chain', and there are two such patterns present."
