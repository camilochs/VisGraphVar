The graph in the image contains two distinct patterns: a chain and a star.

* The chain pattern is formed by the following nodes:
	+ 9
	+ 8
	+ 7
	+ 6
	+ 5

These nodes are connected in a linear sequence, with each node linked to its adjacent nodes. This characteristic aligns with the definition of a chain pattern.

* The star pattern is formed by the following nodes:
	+ 2
	+ 3
	+ 4
	+ 1

The node 2 is connected to all the other nodes in this pattern. This characteristic is consistent with the definition of a star pattern. Node 1 is also connected to node 0, but it does not affect the star pattern formed by nodes 2, 3, and 4.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
  'pattern': ['chain', 'star'],
  'number_of_patterns': 2,
  'analysis': 'The graph contains a chain pattern formed by nodes 9-5, and a star pattern formed by nodes 2-4. Node 2 is connected to all other nodes in the star pattern.'
}
