No image has been provided for analysis. Please provide the graph image so that I can analyze and identify the pattern type according to your instructions.

**If an image of distinct nodes and interconnected links were provided:**
Please note this is an example response based on hypothetical data.

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2, 1, 1],
   'analysis': 'The chain pattern was identified near the left edge, labeled nodes 0-3 forming a chain. In the upper-right corner, numbered 4-7, the nodes are interconnected without any isolated nodes, indicating a clique pattern. Finally, a star pattern is seen above a clique pattern due to a central node (a distinct circle) interconnected with peripheral nodes.'
