**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the given graph, we need to analyze its structure.

**Step 1: Identifying the Structure**

The graph image shows a series of nodes (0 to 7) connected by edges. Each node has a unique number and is linked to its adjacent nodes.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Connections**

Upon closer inspection, we can see that each node is connected only to the next node in sequence (e.g., 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, etc.). There are no direct connections between non-adjacent nodes.

**Step 3: Conclusion and Analysis**

Based on the sequential connection of nodes, we can conclude that the pattern in the graph is a **chain**.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  'pattern': ['chain'],
  'number_of_patterns': [1],
  'analysis': 'The graph shows a linear sequence of nodes with each node connected only to its adjacent neighbors, indicating a chain pattern.'
}
```
