**Step 1: Describe the image**

The image depicts a graph with nodes and edges. In total, there are 10 nodes that can be connected through directed edges. While the image does not contain a full description of the graph, it appears to show separate unconnected subgraphs.



**Step 2: Analysis **

*   The first subgraph contains five nodes in a linear, connected line (5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9)
*   A second subgraph consists of three nodes in a linear connected line (1 to 2 to 10, but with an edge originating from 0 and ending in 4.)  

    This graph is separated into disjointed subgraphs, with one subgraph displaying the form of a chain pattern.



**Step 3: Conclusion**

Based on the following analysis, the graph can be summarised in the following format: 

```json
{
  'pattern': ['chain'],
  'number_of_patterns': [2],
  'analysis': 'The image depicts two separate subgraphs. One consists of 5 connected nodes that display a chain pattern. The second subgraph contains two separate parts: one displayed as a chain pattern of two nodes (11 to 0), while another part displays an edge originating from 0 and ending in 4.'
}
