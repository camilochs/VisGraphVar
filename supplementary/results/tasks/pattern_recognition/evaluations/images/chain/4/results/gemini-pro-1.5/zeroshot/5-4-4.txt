Within each set, the nodes form a chain-like structure, where each node (except the endpoints) is connected to exactly two other nodes in the same set, resembling a path or a line. Specifically:\n\n1. Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 form a chain.\n2. Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 form a chain.\n3. Nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11 form a chain.\n4. Nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15 form a chain.\n\nNo cliques (all nodes interconnected within a set) or stars (one central node connected to all others in a set) are present."
