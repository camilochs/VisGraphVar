Let's analyze the graph step-by-step to identify the pattern type.

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**
   - The graph consists of five distinct groups of nodes.

2. **Determine the type of interconnections in each group:**
   - At the top, nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are linearly connected (one after another).
   - To the left, nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are also linearly connected.
   - In the center bottom, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are linearly connected.
   - To the right, nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 are linearly connected.
   - On the bottom left, nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are linearly connected.

3. **Count the instances of each identified pattern:**
   - There are five distinct linear sequences, often referred to as "chains."

4. **Explain the reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes:**
   - Each group has nodes that are interconnected in a continuous sequence, one after the other. This type of pattern does not show branching, and all nodes in each group form a linear chain.

Thus, the pattern type evident in the entire graph is a chain.

   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": [5],
   "analysis": "Upon analyzing the graph, we identified five distinct clusters of nodes. Each cluster forms a continuous sequence where nodes are directly connected to each other without branching. The type of connection in each cluster is linear, making each group a 'chain'. Every group is independent with its nodes sequentially connected, summing up to five chains in total."
