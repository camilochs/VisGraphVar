I'm sorry, but I don't have the capability to analyze images or access external visual data. However, I can provide a response based on hypothetical information. Please provide a description of the image or graph you would like me to analyze.

Assuming your image contains three distinct clusters with fully interconnected nodes, my response would be:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'I observed the graph structure and identified three distinct clusters, each with nodes that are fully interconnected without isolated nodes, meeting the criteria for a clique pattern.'
}
```

Please replace this with your actual graph description for an accurate analysis.
