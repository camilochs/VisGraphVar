                Step 2: Observing the structure of each cluster, we see that nodes are interconnected in a linear fashion (one after the other). This indicates a continuous or linked sequence, known as a "chain."
                Step 3: Counting the number of clusters, we see there are three such patterns in the graph.
                Step 4: The nodes at the left have a linear sequence starting from 0-4, another sequence from 15-19, and a bottom sequence from 10-14.'
