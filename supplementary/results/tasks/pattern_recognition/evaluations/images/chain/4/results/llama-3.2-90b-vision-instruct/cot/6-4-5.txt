   "pattern": "chain",
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of two distinct clusters that resemble interconnected chains with no isolated nodes or central hubs.\   Both the upper-left and lower-right clusters do not exhibit full interconnections among all nodes, ruling out the clique pattern. 
   Furthermore, neither cluster contains a central node with surrounding peripherals, making the 'star' pattern an inaccurate description. 
   Despite some peripheral nodes, what stands out in both cases is the continuous linear sequence of interconnected nodes, showcasing a 'chain' pattern."
