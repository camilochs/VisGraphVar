To appropriately analyze the graph, let's follow the outlined steps:

1. **Observe the structure**:
   - The graph contains several distinct clusters of interconnected nodes.

2. **Identify distinct clusters and their forms**:
   - **Cluster 1** (top right): Three nodes linked in a triangular manner:**
     - Node 1 (center) connects to nodes 0 and 2.
   - **Cluster 2** (center right): Three nodes linked in a triangular manner:**
     - Node 3 (center) connects to nodes 4 and 5.
   - **Cluster 3** (center left): Three nodes linked in a triangular manner:**
     - Node 6 (center) connects to nodes 7 and 8.
   - **Cluster 4** (left side): Three nodes linked in a triangular manner:**
     - Node 10 (center) connects to nodes 9 and 11.

3. **Determine the pattern type**:
   - Each cluster is interconnected in a way that resembles a triangular or "triangle" shape.

4. **Count the instances of the identified pattern**:
   - There are four such triangular clusters in the graph.

5. **Explanation**:
   - Each cluster consists of three nodes forming a closed loop (or triangle). Not all nodes are directly interconnected, but they collectively form the pattern of interconnected triangles.
