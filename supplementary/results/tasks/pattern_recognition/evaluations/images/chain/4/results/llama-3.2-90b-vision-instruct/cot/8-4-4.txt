**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern type in the graph, we will follow the steps outlined:

1. **Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**: Upon examining the graph, we observe that the nodes are connected in a linear fashion without any central node or a cluster of fully interconnected nodes.

2. **Determine the Interconnection Style**: The nodes are linked one after another in a sequence, which aligns with the definition of a "chain" pattern. There are no indications of a clique, as not all nodes are directly connected to each other, nor is there a star pattern, since there's no central node connecting to multiple peripheral nodes.

3. **Count Instances of Identified Pattern**: Given the linear connection throughout the entire graph, we identify one instance of a continuous chain that encompasses all the shown nodes.

**Conclusion**

Given the analysis, the pattern type identified in the graph is a "chain," with a single instance of this pattern observed across the entire layout of interconnected nodes.
