  "analysis": "The graph consists of three separate components. Each component is a chain, where nodes are connected sequentially. The first chain includes nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. The second chain includes nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.  The third chain includes nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11.  A small chain also connects nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15. Because these chains do not connect to other nodes,  we have three (or four, since we could count the group starting with node 12) distinct chain patterns."
