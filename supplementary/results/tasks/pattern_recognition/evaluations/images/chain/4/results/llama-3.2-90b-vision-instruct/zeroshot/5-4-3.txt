**Graph Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the provided graph image, we need to examine its structure and characteristics.

*   The graph consists of several nodes (0-11) connected by edges.
*   Each node is directly connected to at least one other node.
*   There are no isolated nodes or clusters that are fully interconnected with one another.
*   The connections form lines without any branches connecting to a central point.

Based on these observations:

*   The pattern does not resemble a "clique" because a clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent â€” that is, its edge set is a complete subgraph.
*   The pattern also does not fit the description of a "star" since a star graph is a bipartite graph, and at least one of its partitions contains only one vertex. Furthermore, all edges connect this single vertex to all other vertices.

Given these characteristics, the pattern most closely resembles a "chain" because it consists of a sequence of distinct vertices, such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are at consecutive positions on the sequence. There are no branches or shortcuts between non-consecutive vertices.

**Conclusion**

The final answer is:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1],
   'analysis': 'The graph forms a single sequence of nodes connected linearly without branches or fully interconnected subsets, characteristic of a chain pattern.'
}
