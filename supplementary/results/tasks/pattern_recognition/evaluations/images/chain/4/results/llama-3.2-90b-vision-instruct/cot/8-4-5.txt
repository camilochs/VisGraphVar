Unfortunately, the provided text does not include a graph image. However, I can provide a general template and an exemplary response based on hypothetical observations:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'Upon examining the graph, I observed that the nodes 10 and 15 serve as central nodes with surrounding peripheral nodes. There are two instances of this "star" pattern present in the graph. These patterns are identified by their central nodes having direct connections to all surrounding peripheral nodes, without forming a continuous sequence of interconnected nodes or a fully interconnected cluster.'
}
```

If the image were available, the process would be as follows:

1.  Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters or groups within the graph.
2.  Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (chain), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (clique), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (star).
3.  Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.
4.  Explain the reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes.
