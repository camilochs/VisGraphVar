The graph exhibits a chain pattern, characterized by vertices connected linearly to adjacent pairs. For instance, vertices 7, 6, 5, and 4 are interconnected in a chain, forming a distinct type of pattern:

```json
{
    "pattern": ["chain"],
    "number_of_patterns": 4,
    "analysis": "Each chain connects adjacent pairs of vertices, forming a continuous sequence that only terminates when an endpoint is reached, and there are multiple separate and independent chain patterns in the graph."
}
```

In summary, the graph comprises multiple separate and independent chain patterns, each connecting adjacent pairs of vertices and forming continuous sequences.
