**Pattern Analysis**

To analyze the given graph image, we need to understand the definitions of 'chain,' 'clique,' and 'star' patterns in graph theory.

*   A **chain** is a sequence of vertices connected by edges, where no two adjacent edges share a vertex and no vertex is connected to more than two other vertices.
*   A **clique** is a subset of vertices in a graph such that every pair of them is connected by an edge. A clique represents a group of highly interconnected nodes.
*   A **star** is a graph with four vertices, where one central vertex is connected to all other vertices, and no other edges exist.

Looking at the provided graph image:

*   There are multiple sequences of vertices connected by edges (e.g., 10-11-9, 5-4-3), but they do not share any characteristics of being part of a single chain because they are disjoint and not sequentially connected.
*   It does not exhibit any clique structure as there isn't a subset of vertices where every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex. 
*   The graph does not resemble a 'star' since there isn't a single central vertex connected to all others with no additional connections among those outer vertices.

Given the above observations and definitions, the graph does not fit neatly into the defined patterns of 'chain,' 'clique,' or 'star' based solely on the visual inspection and standard definitions. However, since an exact match to these specific patterns isn't identified, and considering the nature of the task which implies looking for patterns specifically within 'chain,' 'clique,' or 'star,' we must conclude based on the possibilities provided. The presence of sequences (or chains) of connected vertices could loosely align with a 'chain' pattern if we consider each disconnected sequence as separate 'chains.' Yet, this interpretation stretches the definition as these do not form continuous sequences across the graph.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": ["3"],
   "analysis": "The graph contains sequences of connected vertices, which can be interpreted as separate chain patterns, although they are not interlinked."
}
```

Please note that strictly adhering to common graph theory definitions, none of these sequences perfectly fit the typical understanding of a 'chain' without further context or relaxation of these definitions. This response is crafted to fit the format and options provided, acknowledging the stretch in pattern identification compared to conventional graph theory definitions.
