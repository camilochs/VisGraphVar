   "analysis": "The graph contains multiple linear sequences of nodes connected one after another without branching. These 'chain' patterns are present as groups of three or more nodes connected directly (e.g., nodes 0-1-2, 3-4-5, 6-7-8, 9-10-11). Each sequence forms a simple unbranched path characteristic of a chain pattern."
