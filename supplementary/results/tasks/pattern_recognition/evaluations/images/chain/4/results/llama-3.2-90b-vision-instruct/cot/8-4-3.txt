**Step 1: Identify distinct clusters, groups, or links**

The graph consists of several disconnected subgraphs, each forming a cluster or group of nodes. The nodes are numbered from 0 to 12, with some nodes missing (13 and above are not shown). Two of these subgraphs form chains while one forms a clique.

**Step 2: Determine how many chains, cliques or stars there are**

There are many interconnected nodes which are all part of two cycles, and one subgraph where all nodes are each connected to every other node.

With node 0 connected to both 1 and 2, we can conclude that the most common pattern is a chain. However, there is also an instance of a clique involving nodes numbered 3, 4 and 5.

**Step 3: Count how many patterns there are per pattern type**

There are two chain patterns, involving nodes 0, 1, 2 and 8, 7, 6, for a total of two chain instances.

Also, there is only one clique instance, among nodes 3, 4 and 5.



**Conclusion (f.u.E to answer as per your question insensitive format)**

```json
{'pattern':['chain','clique'],'number_of_patterns':[2,1],'analysis':'We see 2 chain patterns pairing up 4 nodes, as well as 1 clique which 3 nodes are part of.'}
