   "analysis": "The graph consists of five distinct linear chains of nodes, each with a continuous sequence of connections without any branching or isolated nodes. These chains are evident in the groups of nodes 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15, and 10-11. Each chain follows a clear, sequential pattern without forming a clique or a star structure. Therefore, the pattern type is identified as 'chain'."
