Each 'chain' consists of nodes connected in a linear sequence, where each node is connected to exactly two other nodes (except for the nodes at the ends of the chain which are connected to only one node). The chains are made up of nodes 7, 6, 5, 4; nodes 0, 1, 2, 3; nodes 11, 10, 9, 8; and nodes 15, 14, 13, 12."
