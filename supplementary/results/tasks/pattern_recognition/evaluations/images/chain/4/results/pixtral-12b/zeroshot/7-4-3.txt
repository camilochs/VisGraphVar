Based on the provided graph, here is the analysis in the required JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3, 1, 2],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains different patterns distributed across three subgraphs. Specifically, there are three "chain" patterns where nodes are linearly connected in a sequence. There is one "clique" pattern where nodes are fully connected to each other, forming a tight group, and there are two "star" patterns where one central node is connected to other peripheral nodes.'
}
```

This detailed analysis helps in identifying the types and counts of patterns present within the graph.
