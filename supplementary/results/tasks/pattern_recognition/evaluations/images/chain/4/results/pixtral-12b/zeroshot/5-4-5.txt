Based on the provided graph, the pattern observed is multiple chains. Here is the analysis in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains four linear sequences of nodes where each node is connected to exactly two other nodes (except for the nodes at each end of the sequences). This structure characterizes a chain pattern. Each chain is a linear sequence of nodes.'
}
