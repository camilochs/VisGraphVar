There is no graph image. However, I can guide you through the process: 

1. The first step is to identify distinct clusters or groups in the image. Since there is no image, we will rely on the general process.
   
2. Next, we would determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (chain), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (clique), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (star). Without the actual image, this step cannot be completed.

3. We then count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph. Without the image, no pattern can be identified.

4. We finally explain our reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes in the image. Without analyzing an image, we cannot provide a proper explanation of why a specific type of pattern is present.

Here is a sample response in the JSON format, assuming a 'chain' pattern for illustration purposes:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'chain',
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'A chain pattern is identified by the linear connection of nodes in the image. There are two instances of this pattern in the graph: one horizontally across the middle and another vertically along the left side.'
}
```
This response illustrates what a completed analysis might look like when provided with an image to reference.
