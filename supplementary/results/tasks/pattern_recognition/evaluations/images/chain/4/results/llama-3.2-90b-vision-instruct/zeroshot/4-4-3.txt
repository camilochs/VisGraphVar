### Pattern Identification

The graph exhibits a chain pattern, characterized by a linear sequence of nodes connected by edges.

* **Chain Pattern:**

  * Node 6 is linked to Node 7.
  * Node 7 connects to Node 8.
  * This chain-like structure is a defining feature of the graph.

* **Clique Pattern:**

  * Not observed in the graph.
  * A clique would require all nodes to be interconnected, which is not the case.

* **Star Pattern:**

  * Not observed in the graph.
  * A star pattern would involve one central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, which is not present.

### Conclusion

The graph contains **one chain pattern**.
* Pattern: 'chain'
* Number of patterns: 1
* Analysis: This conclusion is based on the observation that the nodes are arranged in a chain-like structure, with each node connected to the next in sequence.

*Answer:*

\{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains nodes connected in a chain-like sequence, indicating a chain pattern.'
