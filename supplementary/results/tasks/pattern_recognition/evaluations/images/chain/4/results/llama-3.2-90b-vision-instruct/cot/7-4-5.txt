Based on the graph image, the following patterns can be observed:

*   Three distinct clusters of connected nodes
*   No complete interconnection among all nodes or chain-like sequence
*   No central node with surrounding peripheral nodes

The repeat pattern identified in the graph is the 'chain' pattern, occurring three times. Each instance is separate from the others.
