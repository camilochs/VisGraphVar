Given the lack of an image, I will provide an example of a detailed answer with the specified JSON format.

**Step 1: Image Analysis**

Since no image is provided, let's assume there is a graph image with a 'Chain' like pattern consisting of interconnected nodes.

**Step 2: Pattern Answer in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    'pattern': ['chain'],
    'number_of_patterns': [1],
    'analysis': 'Based on the graph image (not seen), the nodes are continuously interconnected without any central node or isolated cluster, which matches a chain pattern. Additionally, no multiple clusters of connected nodes or cliques can be found.'
}
```

This answer represents an assumption of the existence of a 'Chain' pattern in the graph image.

This response shows the exact example of answer.
