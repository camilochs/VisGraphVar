**Step 1: Analyze the Image**

The image displays a graph with nodes (1 through 15) and the connections between them.

**Step 2: Define Possible Patterns**

The possible patterns are:

- Chain: A sequence of interconnected nodes.
- Clique: All nodes are connected to each other.
- Star: Central node connected to multiple surrounding nodes.

**Step 3: Identify the Pattern**

Based on the image, we can see that there are multiple clusters of nodes. Each cluster can be considered a chain pattern within the graph.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Considering the nodes and their connections, we determine that the graph consists of multiple chains.

**Answer**

```json
{
   "pattern": "chain",
   "number_of_patterns": "5",
   "analysis": "The graph comprises of multiple linear sequences of nodes, such as 8-9-10-11, 7-6-5-4, 15-14-13-12, 0-1, and 2-3, each aligning with the chain pattern."
