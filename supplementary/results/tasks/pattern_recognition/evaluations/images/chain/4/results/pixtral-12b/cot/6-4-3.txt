Upon analyzing the graph based on the given steps, we can identify the pattern types as follows:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": [4],
   "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters, each forming a linear sequence of interconnected nodes where each node, except the ends, has exactly two neighboring nodes. This linear arrangement characterizes a 'chain' pattern. These are the specific sequences observed: (0-1-2), (5-4-3), (6-7), and (9-10-11). None of these clusters appear as fully interconnected nodes (clique) or a central node with peripheral nodes (star). Hence, the pattern type for all clusters in this graph is a 'chain'."
}
