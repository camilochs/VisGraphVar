To identify the pattern in the image graph, we must examine its structure and connections among the nodes. 

* In a 'chain' pattern, nodes are connected in a linear sequence, with each node connecting to exactly two others except for the first and last nodes.
* A 'clique' pattern consists of all nodes being directly connected to each other, forming a complete subgraph.
* A 'star' pattern features a central node connected to all other nodes, with these outer nodes having no connections to each other.

Upon examining the provided graph, we see that if it is represented as an undirected graph, a 'star' pattern is observed. It is structured such that a central node connects directly to all other nodes, and these peripheral nodes do not connect to each other. This direct connection from a central node to all other nodes without connections among the peripheral nodes is a primary feature of a 'star' pattern.

: The image graph was analyzed based on its description, given for an illustration of the pattern identification process without visually examining it.

    'pattern': "star",
    'number_of_patterns': 1,
    'analysis': "The central node connects directly to all other nodes, which have no connections to each other."
