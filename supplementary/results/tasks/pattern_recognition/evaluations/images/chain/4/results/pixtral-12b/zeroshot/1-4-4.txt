Two of these patterns are chains, where nodes are connected in a linear sequence, and one is a star, where a central node connects to multiple peripheral nodes. The chains are located in the top-right and bottom-left sections of the image, while the star pattern is on the bottom-right. Each pattern exhibits distinct connectivity characteristics that lead to their respective classifications.'
