The second pattern, starting from node 4 and ending at node 7, is also a chain with four nodes. The third pattern is a star centered around node 5, with nodes 4, 6, and 7 connected to it. The fourth pattern, starting from node 15 and ending at node 12, is a chain with four nodes. Each pattern is characterized by its linear, central, or branching structure.'
