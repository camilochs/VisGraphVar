  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct sets of interconnected nodes. Each set forms a chain-like structure where nodes are linked sequentially. Specifically:\n\n1. Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 form a chain.\n2. Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 form a chain.\n3. Nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11 form a chain.\n4. Nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15 form a chain.\n\nTherefore, the identified pattern is 'chain,' and there are four such patterns in the graph."
