**Graph Analysis**

The provided graph image exhibits a chain pattern, characterized by a linear sequence of nodes.

* Each node is connected to its immediate neighbors, with no connections between non-adjacent nodes.
* The nodes are arranged in a straight line, lacking any branching or cycles.

**Answer:**

```json
{
  "pattern": ["chain"],
  "number_of_patterns": 1,
  "analysis": "The graph exhibits a linear structure with each node connected to its immediate neighbors, forming a chain pattern."
}
