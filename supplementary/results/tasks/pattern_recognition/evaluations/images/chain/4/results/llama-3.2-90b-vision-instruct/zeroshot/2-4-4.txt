I am unable to view the image graph that you are referring to. However the following is an example where I would respond as instructed but replace items appropriately. 


```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 1,
   'analysis': 'A star pattern is present in the graph image. This is because the central node (1) is connected to multiple nodes (0, 2, 3) that are not connected to each other, indicating that the central node has a higher degree of centrality. This characteristic is typical of star patterns, where a central node has many edges connected to it, while the other nodes have few or no edges between them.'
}
```
