The graph consists of multiple clusters of nodes, each with distinct interconnections. Here's a detailed analysis to identify the pattern type:

1. **Observation of Structure**:
   - There are multiple groups of nodes, notably four distinct clusters.

2. **Interconnections and Layout**:
   - **Cluster 1 (Top Right)**: Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are connected in a straight line. This suggests a linear or sequential pattern.
   - **Cluster 2 (Mid Left)**: Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are connected in a 90-degree bend formation, meaning there is a directional flow in a more structured sequence but not entirely linear.
   - **Cluster 3 (Bottom Left)**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected in a straight line.
   - **Cluster 4 (Bottom Right)**: Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 form a vertical line.

3. **Pattern Identification**:
   - **Chains**: Based on the linear arrangement of nodes in each cluster, the pattern can be identified as `'chain'`.
   - **Claques**: Fully interconnected clusters to form cliques are not present in this graph.
   - **Stars**: No central nodes with peripheral nodes exist here either.

4. **Count Instances**:
   - Number of **chain** patterns: 4.

5. **Reasoning**:
   - Each cluster (or group of nodes) follows a sequential, connected format where each node links directly to the next.
   - This is characteristic of a **chain** pattern.
   - No clusters exhibit the structure of a **clique** or **star**.

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": 4,
   "analysis": "The graph has distinct clusters each consisting of nodes connected linearly. This sequential connection between nodes forms a 'chain' pattern in all four clusters. This indicates there are 4 instances of the 'chain' pattern in the graph."
