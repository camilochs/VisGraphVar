   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct chain patterns. Each chain consists of nodes connected in a linear sequence where each node (except endpoints) connects to exactly two other nodes. The chains are: [4-5-6-7], [12-13-14-15], [0-1-2-3], and [8-9-10-11]. None of the nodes have more than two connections, ruling out star or clique patterns."
