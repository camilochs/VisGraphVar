**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the type of pattern present in the graph, we will analyze its structure and identify the characteristics that define a 'chain', 'clique', or 'star' pattern.

**Pattern Identification**

*   A chain pattern consists of nodes connected in a linear sequence with each node having a degree of two, except for the endpoints which have a degree of one.
*   A clique pattern consists of all nodes being fully connected to each other, meaning every node has an edge connecting it to every other node.
*   A star pattern consists of one central node connected to all other nodes, while these outer nodes are not connected to each other.

**Analysis of the Graph**

Upon examining the graph, we observe two distinct paths consisting of nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. These paths exhibit the characteristics of a chain pattern, where each internal node is connected only to its immediate neighbors, and the endpoints have a single connection.

Another chain pattern is observed with nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Similar to the first two chains, this path also follows the chain pattern structure.

A fourth chain pattern is observed in nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Like the first three chains, this chain has nodes connected linearly and matches the chain pattern criteria.

**Conclusion**

Based on the structural analysis, the graph contains multiple instances of the 'chain' pattern. The number of distinct chain patterns observed in the graph is four. The defining feature that led to this conclusion was the observation of linear sequences of nodes with internal nodes having a degree of two and endpoints having a degree of one.
