**Pattern Classification Result**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph image contains multiple patterns where all nodes except the two end vertices in each pattern have degree 2, which is indicative of chains. No patterns were observed that resembled cliques or stars, due to lack of full connectivity or a single high degree vertex with degree 1 neighboring vertices, respectively.'
}
```

Answer: The graph image contains three chain patterns with no clique or star patterns present.
