   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct chain patterns where nodes are connected in a linear sequence. The chains are: (9-10-11), (2-1-0), (8-7-6), and (5-4-3). Each chain consists of three nodes connected sequentially, with no branching or multiple connections to a single central node, which is characteristic of chain patterns."
