   'analysis': "The observed graph consists of distinct clusters of nodes, each forming a sequence connected linearly. To identify the pattern, follow these steps:

   Step 1: Observe the structure. Each cluster in the graph consists of a series of nodes interconnected in a linear manner without forming a loop.

   Step 2: Determine the pattern type by examining the connections. Each group of nodes forms a chain-like structure, where each node is only connected directly to two other nodes (one on each side).

   Step 3: Count the instances. There are a total of 3 distinct clusters in the graph, each displaying the chain pattern.

   Step 4: Explain the reasoning. The consistent and linear interconnectedness of the nodes in each cluster indicates a chain pattern. Each cluster of nodes is connected sequentially, with each node interlinked directly before and after it in the series.

   Consequently, the pattern identified in the graph image is a chain pattern, appearing three times."
