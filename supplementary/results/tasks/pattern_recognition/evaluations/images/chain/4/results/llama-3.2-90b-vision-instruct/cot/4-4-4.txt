Based on the analysis of the graph image, here is the identified pattern type response in JSON format:

```json
{
    'pattern': ['chain'],
    'number_of_patterns': 4,
    'analysis': 'Upon careful observation, the graph consists of distinct clusters, where each cluster represents a series of connected nodes. These clusters are isolated from one another, indicating the absence of a central node or fully interconnected nodes. The sequence within each cluster exhibits a continuous connection between the nodes, resembling a chain-like structure. Therefore, the identified pattern type is "chain" with four instances present in the graph.'
}
```

In summary, the graph consists of four distinct chains, each comprising a sequence of connected nodes without any indication of a central node or fully interconnected nodes. This conclusion is based on the analysis of the graph's layout and structure.
