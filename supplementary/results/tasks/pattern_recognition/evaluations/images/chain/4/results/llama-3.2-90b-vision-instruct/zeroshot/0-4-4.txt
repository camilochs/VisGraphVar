### Pattern Type Classification

*   **Pattern Identification**: The graph exhibits a chain pattern, characterized by a linear or sequential arrangement of nodes with no additional connections (cliques) or central nodes (stars) with multiple branches.
*   **Number of Patterns**: The graph contains a single chain pattern.
*   **Analysis**: The graph features a chain pattern with 16 sequential nodes. Each node is connected to the next node in the sequence, devoid of interleaved connections (cliques) or emanating branches (stars). The linear structure classifies this graph as a chain, requiring node 1 to access node 2, and node 2 to reach node 3, or any other node accordingly.
