The pattern type identified in the graph primarily consists of 'chains'. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": [4],
   "analysis": [
       "Step 1: Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links. The graph contains multiple linear sequences of interconnected nodes.",
       "Step 2: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star'). Here each node is part of a linear sequence without branching or fully interconnected clusters.",
       "Step 3: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph. There are four clear sequences where nodes are linked in a straight line.",
       "Analysis: There is a chain starting from node 7 to node 4, another from node 6 to node 4, a shorter sequence from node 15 to node 12, and a long queue from node 15 to node 11."
    ]
}
```

This analysis indicates that the most prominent pattern is the 'chain' structure, where nodes are sequentially linked without forming other complex configurations.
