I'm happy to help you with your task. However, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to visually analyze images or access real-time information. I can provide general guidance on how to approach this task.

To identify the pattern type in a graph image, you can follow the steps you provided:

1. Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.
2. Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').
3. Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.
4. Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes.

For example, assuming you have analyzed the graph image, here's a sample JSON response:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2, 1],
   'analysis': 'Based on the layout and relationships among nodes, I identified 2 instances of a chain pattern and 1 instance of a clique pattern. The chain pattern is characterized by nodes interconnected in a continuous sequence, while the clique pattern is characterized by fully interconnected nodes without isolated nodes.'
}
```

Please note that this is a hypothetical example, and you should replace the values with your actual observations and analysis.

I hope this helps you complete your task. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask.
