**Step 1 - Identifying patterns in the overall graph structure**

Upon careful observation of the given graph, it becomes apparent that the nodes are arranged in a distinct pattern. The graph consists of four clusters: three larger clusters and one smaller cluster.

**Step 2 - Identifying the pattern type for each cluster**

In this case, we can observe that each cluster consists of multiple nodes. Specifically, Cluster 1 has 4 nodes, Cluster 2 has 3 nodes, Cluster 3 has 3 nodes, and Cluster 4 has 2 nodes. There are no isolated nodes or clusters, suggesting that each cluster is fully interconnected.

**Step 3 - Identifying the number of patterns**

Based on the observed clusters, it is evident that all four clusters exhibit a star pattern. Each cluster has a central node surrounded by peripheral nodes.

**Step 4 - Finalizing the answer**

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

\[
\text{{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of four clusters, each exhibiting a star pattern with a central node and surrounding peripheral nodes.'
 }
}
