**Step 1: Define patterns to compare**

*   Star pattern: In the graph theory, star or star graph means Graph consists center vertices or target around which connects every other point in such a manner that no edge between the other vertices exist. 
*   Clique pattern: Clique defined as set of vertices where an edge connects every  pair distinct of vertices and from remainder to set to none is joined.
*   Chain pattern: It can be defined as a Graph with path consisting of path sequence linearly ordered, which means there is no path sequence in between those linearly ordered path sequence in nÂ  number of nodes. Also known as n-ary tree.



**Step 2: Identify the patterns in the provided graph image**

The graph appears to be an unweighted, undirected graph. It has 11 edges and 11 vertices.



**Step 3: Draw conclusions**

To know the given structure of a graphic, start from each node and check if there are links to other nodes.



    If the output is: 
    
    *   At least some nodes which are connected pairwise.
    
    *   Linkages between a minimum pair of them are not available.

    Conclusion- Answer would be: **Star Pattern**.



    If the output is
    
    *   Each node of the graph is connected pairwise.
    
    *   Linkage gap in none of the node.

    Conclusion- Answer would be: **Clique Pattern**.



This example demonstrates that each node is paired and not linked. Thus, the answer is **Star Pattern**.



**Step 4: Conclude and provide the final answer**

Answer:

```json
{
       "pattern": "Star",
       "number_of_patterns": "1",
       "analysis": "There is one center node connected to various other nodes. There also exists the absence of any linkage when paired."
}
```
