The image displays a graph with 20 nodes, each containing a number. The nodes are arranged in four distinct groups or chains. 

Upon closer inspection, it appears that each group forms a chain where the nodes are connected in a sequence. There are no instances of cliques (where all nodes are fully interconnected) or stars (where a central node has surrounding peripheral nodes). 

Therefore, based on the layout and relationships among the nodes, the identified pattern type is a chain, and there are four instances of this pattern in the image.

Answer:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'chain',
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'The image displays a graph with twenty nodes, each containing a number, that are arranged into four distinct groups or chains. The nodes are connected in sequence, making them a chain. There are no instances in the image of a clique, where all the nodes are fully interconnected, or a star, where a central node has surrounding peripheral nodes. Therefore, there are four instances of a chain pattern, as all of the nodes can be identified as a chain pattern.'
}
```
