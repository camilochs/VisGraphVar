Per the provided guidelines, let's analyze the graph to identify the pattern type:

1. In this graph, we have multiple sets of interconnected nodes but no single sequence of nodes that are continuously connected to end-to-end, i.e., no chain. Each set has fully interconnected nodes and no node is left out. For example, in the right lower corner, nodes 7, 8, and 6 are all connected to each other without any remaining nodes left isolated from the group.
2. As identified in the previous step, each set of nodes is fully interconnected without any left isolated. Hence, the pattern is not a star with a central node.
3. We see three clusters in this image.
4. Hence, the pattern type is ‘clique’ based on continuously interconnected nodes that are isolated from each node left in the rest of the graph.

The solution would be: 

```
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "No continuous sequence of nodes was found in the graph. However, we have identified three clusters of fully interconnected nodes that are isolated from the rest of the nodes (left upper, right center, and left lower.) Hence, we have identified the pattern as 'clique' with the total count of 'cliques' in the graph being 3."
