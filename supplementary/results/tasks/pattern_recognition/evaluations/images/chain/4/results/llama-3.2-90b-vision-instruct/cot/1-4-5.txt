Since the original prompt did not include a graph image to analyze, I will create a hypothetical example based on steps 1 through 4 in the original prompt, which are utilized to identify pattern types in a graph.

```json
{
  "pattern": ["star"],
  "number_of_patterns": 3,
  "analysis": "Three distinct patterns were identified in the graph image forming stars, each with nodes clustered around a central connected node."
}
```

In the provided analysis response, since a graph image was missing in the request, the answer will address how the pattern of a 'star' is identified.
The three distinct patterns of a 'star' were identified in the hypothetical graph image by applying the four-step strategy from the prompt to analyze the depicted graph. 
1) From step one in the original prompt, distinct clusters of interconnected nodes are identified.
2) As instructed in the second step, three distinct patterns of interconnected nodes were determined, 
which fit the model of 'stars' since central nodes surrounded peripheral structures, connected at a single point.
3) In following the third step, the 'star' pattern appears three times in the examined graph, allowing for the conclusion that the pattern present is a 'star.'
4) This answers the prompt's call to present the analysis in a JSON written format. 
Note at large numbers of instances in multiple patterns, the number of the 4th step may become so large that the response may require additional adjustments not addressed in this hypothetical context.
