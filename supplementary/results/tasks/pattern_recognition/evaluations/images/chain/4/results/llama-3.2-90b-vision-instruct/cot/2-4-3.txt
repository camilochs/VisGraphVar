**Analysis of the Graph Image**

Given the graph structure, we observe that there are several groups of interconnected nodes. 

Upon closer inspection, we notice a series of linked nodes (9, 10, 11), where each node is directly connected to the next one in a sequence. This characteristic is typical of a chain pattern. 

Additionally, we identify a group of nodes (5, 4, 3) that form a small chain and another group (8, 7, 6) that also exhibits a chain-like structure. Furthermore, we observe isolated chain-like structures with only two nodes (1, 2) and a single isolated node (0).

Based on the distinct clusters characterized by a sequential arrangement, we deduce that this graph predominantly features chain patterns. 

The number of chain instances is determined by counting each separate chain structure in the graph. 

There are a total of 4 instances of the chain pattern in the graph.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the graph image primarily comprises chain patterns, with a total of 4 instances.
