**Step 1: Analyzing the given pattern**

The image shows a social network where each number represents an entity, and the edges indicate a relationship between entities.

**Step 2: Identify the type of pattern and its characteristics**

-   A chain pattern is a sequence of edges connecting at least three nodes in a path that follows in a line (a-->b-->c-->d...). The sequence of nodes must not circle around each other; following at more than two points.
-   A clique pattern is a graph where *every* node is connected to **every other node**. In the chart given, there is no example of this pattern.
-   A star pattern is a design that has one central hub node connected to many other nodes surrounding it.

**Step 3: Performing an analysis of the given image file**

The image shows a few examples of a star pattern, with no chain patterns present and one clique pattern.

*   In the up- right part of the image, there is a star pattern with ten nodes (9 connections from one central point).
*   In the upper-left part of the image, there is a star pattern with two nodes (two connections from one central point).
*   There is one clique contained in the image (Nodes 1,2,3 and 4).
*   There are several subgraphs that function as a clique (Nodes 6 and 7, 8 and 5).
*   There are other relationships shown, but they do not fit any of the 3 named patterns.

**Final answer:**

```json
{
  "pattern": "star",
  "number_of_patterns": "2",
  "analysis": "The graph image contains two star patterns, one with nine connections and the other with two connections, and one clique pattern with four connections to show the relationship between each node."
}
