   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct chain patterns where nodes are connected in a linear sequence. These chains are: (4-5-6-7), (0-1-2-3), (8-9-10-11), and (12-13-14-15). Each node in these chains is connected to at most two other nodes, forming a linear structure without any branches or central hubs."
