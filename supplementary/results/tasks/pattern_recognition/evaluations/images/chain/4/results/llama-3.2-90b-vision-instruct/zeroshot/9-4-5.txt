**Step 1: Identify the structure of the graph.**

The image shows a graph with nodes arranged in a series of non-overlapping linear sequences. There are multiple separate chains, each containing distinctive U-shapes and straight segments.

**Step 2: Evaluate the nodes and edges in the image.**

Each node is a circle containing a unique number. The nodes between shared edges are not sorted numerically, and each has a unique value.

**Step 3: Determine connected node groups and edges that are not part of a chain.**

Multiple groups start with a pair of nodes connected at both the beginning and end with the opposite U-shaped node from the other group. The connected groups can vary from two to five total nodes.

**Step 4: Evaluate all adjacent nodes inside separated parts identified in Step 3.**

The groups contain some nodes that would fit a chain, but are always separated by a complete node chain or a group that itself does not yield an outcome (since each link always consists of single node connections). Each group can be considered branching from a U-shaped pair in the center.

**Step 5: Count the number of multi-connected groups.**

There are four, consisting of (from top to bottom and left to right) one U-shaped node chain group (group 1), two pairs of chains connected at a 'fork' (routed as group 2, then group 3), and a group of single line U-type-based connection (group 4).

**Step 6: Compare or create sets of pattern properties relevant to given types and calculate occurrences.**

None of the unbalanced connection shapes are found with three or more connections to a single node. However, no chain patterns occur either. This confirms the solution must contain only the clique category, as the regularity of perfectly-balanced dual, triple, or quad U-patterns giving accumulator pairing would always generate one occurrence of a clique property (multi-group connected alike nodes) for every one of any other set of a total n-group levels, and all groupings across the image were in balanced form corresponding with shared criterion pattern detections clearly only being their neighbor clique cases as the values all necessarily exceed the single-connection minimum.

**Step 7: Filter all other categories and assertion the answer within the final count.**



**Conclusion: **

The cumulative effort and findings in the steps for the Test case above point to the attached algorithm used for producing a final solution in a graph component pattern (clique) that fit perfectly within a context of given possible categories and definitely provided explanations and analysis supporting the new and following answers.
