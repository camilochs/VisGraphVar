   "analysis": "The graph shows four distinct linear sequences where nodes are connected in a continuous path. Specifically: 1) A chain of nodes 0-1-2-3, 2) A chain of nodes 4-5-6-7, 3) A chain of nodes 8-9-10-11, and 4) A chain of nodes 12-13-14-15. Each sequence follows a chain pattern where nodes are connected to exactly two other nodes (except for end nodes which connect to only one node), forming linear paths. There are no central nodes with multiple connections (ruling out star pattern) and no fully interconnected clusters (ruling out clique pattern). The clear linear arrangement of nodes in sequence confirms these are chain patterns."
