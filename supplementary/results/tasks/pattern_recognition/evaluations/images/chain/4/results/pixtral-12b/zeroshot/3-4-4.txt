The first chain is located in the top-right corner and includes nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. The second chain is positioned above the central cluster and includes nodes 7, 6, 5, and 4. The third chain is situated in the bottom region and includes nodes 15, 14, 13, and 12. Each chain pattern shows a one-dimensional linear progression of connections.'
