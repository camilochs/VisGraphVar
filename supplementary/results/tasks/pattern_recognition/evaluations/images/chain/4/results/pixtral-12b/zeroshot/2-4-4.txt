   'analysis': 'The graph exhibits two main types of patterns: "clique" and "chain." A clique pattern is observed where nodes 7, 8, 5, and 4 form a densely interconnected subgraph. Additionally, chain patterns are seen in multiple places: the sequence of nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 and nodes 12, 13, 14, 15 represent linear sequences where each node connects to exactly two other nodes, forming a direct chain.'
