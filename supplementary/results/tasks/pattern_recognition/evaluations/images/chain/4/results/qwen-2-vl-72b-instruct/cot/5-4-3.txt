   "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters, each containing a sequence of interconnected nodes. These clusters are: 0-1-2, 3-4-5, 6-7-8, and 9-10-11. Each cluster forms a chain pattern as the nodes are connected in a linear sequence without any branching or additional connections outside the sequence. Therefore, the identified pattern type is 'chain', and there are four instances of this pattern in the graph."
