Based on the steps provided, let's analyze the graph:

1. **Observing the Structure**:
   - There are four distinct groups of nodes in the graph.
   - Each group contains nodes that are linked sequentially or in a clustered manner.

2. **Identifying Pattern Types**:
   - Nodes 0 → 1 → 2 form a chain.
   - Nodes 6 → 7 → 8 form a chain.
   - Nodes 5 → 4 → 3 form a chain.
   - Nodes 10 → 9 → 11 form a chain.
   - None of the groups are fully interconnected, nor do any of the nodes meet the criteria for a star pattern.

3. **Counting Pattern Instances**:
   - There are four distinct chains.

4. **Explanation**:
   - In the group of nodes 0, 1, and 2, nodes are connected in a sequential manner forming a chain.
   - In the group of nodes 6, 7, and 8, nodes are connected in a sequential manner forming a chain.
   - In the group of nodes 5, 4, and 3, nodes are connected in a sequential manner forming a chain.
   - In the group of nodes 10, 9, and 11, nodes are connected in a sequential manner forming a chain.
   - There are no cliques or star patterns identified.
