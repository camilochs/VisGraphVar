**Step Conclusion Step 3 Pattern Type Determination**

Based on the analysis conducted, we can determine the type of pattern present in the graph image.

* **Step 4**: From the analysis in Step 3, we observe chains of nodes with connecting edges and no cliques or stars.
* **Step 5**: This pattern corresponds to the 'chain' pattern.

Therefore, the following JSON response indicates the type of pattern and the number of occurrences in the graph image.

* **Step 6**: The JSON response is:

```json
{"pattern": ["chain"], "number_of_patterns": 4, "analysis": "We observe chains of nodes with connecting edges and no cliques or stars."}
```

This response indicates that the graph image contains 4 occurrences of the 'chain' pattern and explains the features that led to this conclusion.
