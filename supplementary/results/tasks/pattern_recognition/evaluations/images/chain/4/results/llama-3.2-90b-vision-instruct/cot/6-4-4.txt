Based on the provided image, here's a structured and polished analysis to identify the graph pattern:

**Answer:** 

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'The graph image shows two distinct clusters, characterized by one central node surrounded by peripheral nodes. Each central node connects to its neighboring peripheral nodes, but there are no direct connections between peripheral nodes. In both clusters, the central node (at the top and bottom) has multiple links to other nodes, forming a star pattern. No chains or cliques are evident, as the connections do not form continuous sequences or fully interconnected groups without isolation.' 
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   The graph layout reveals two clusters with distinct central nodes (labeled 14 and 10) connected to their neighboring peripheral nodes.
*   The absence of direct connections between peripheral nodes eliminates the possibility of a chain or clique pattern.
*   Each central node's multiple links to other nodes create a star pattern, with the central node surrounded by peripheral nodes.
*   As a result, the identified pattern is a "star" pattern, with two instances of this pattern type present in the graph image.
