   'pattern': ['chain', 'chain', 'star', 'chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'The graph contains four distinct patterns: three "chain" patterns and one "star" pattern. Each "chain" pattern features nodes connected in a linear sequence, while the "star" pattern has one central node connected to three peripheral nodes.'
}
```

Explanation:
1. The pattern labeled "chain" consists of nodes connected in a straight line. This configuration repeats three times in the graph.
2. One pattern is identified as a "star," where a central node connects to three surrounding nodes.

The analysis confirms the nature of these connectivity patterns through visual inspection and identification of node connections.
