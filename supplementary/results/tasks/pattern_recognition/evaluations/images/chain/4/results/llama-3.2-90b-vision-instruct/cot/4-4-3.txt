The pattern in the graph is a clique.

**Number of Patterns:**
There are 4 instances of cliques in the graph.

**Explanation:**
To determine the pattern type, we analyzed the graph based on the given steps:

* The graph consists of several nodes connected by edges, forming clusters.
* We identified distinct clusters, groups, or links: (6,7,8), (1,0,2), (3,4,5), and (9,10,11).
* Each cluster contains nodes interconnected without isolated nodes, characteristic of a clique pattern.
* No chains or stars are visible in the graph, as there are no continuous sequences or central nodes with surrounding peripheral nodes.
* Therefore, the pattern type is a clique, and there are 4 instances of this pattern in the graph.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
