    "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct chain patterns. Each chain is characterized by nodes connected in a linear sequence where each node (except endpoints) connects to exactly two other nodes. The chains are: (15-14-13-12), (3-2-1-0), (4-5-6-7), and (11-10-9-8). None of the nodes form complete cliques or star patterns."
