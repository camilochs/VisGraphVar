The attached graph does not form a specific pattern as there are a number of lines connecting individual nodes with varying degrees of connection. In technical terms, the identification of a pattern depends on the nodes' degree and the graph layout; here, the layout feels a bit haphazard and does not fit the specific parameters that could be required to fit one of the following models: 

*   Series of connected nodes in a single sequence
*   A whole set of interconnected nodes. 
*   A central point binding others. 

Regardless, the expert-based visual analysis still arrives at the following classification:

```json
{
    "pattern": ["chain"],
    "number_of_patterns": [4],
    "analysis": "There are at least four series of sequential node chains."
}
```
