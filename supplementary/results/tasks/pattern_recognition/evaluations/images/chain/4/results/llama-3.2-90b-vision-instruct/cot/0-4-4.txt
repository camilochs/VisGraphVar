**Answer:** 


```json
{
  'pattern': 'star',
  'number_of_patterns': 3,
  'analysis': 'The graph image has three distinct clusters where there is a central node interconnected with surrounding peripheral nodes. There are three groups with central nodes 0, 14, 6, consisting of nodes 1,2,3,8,9,10,11 (first group), 12,13,14,15 (second group), 4,5,6,7 (third group). This confirms the star pattern.'
}
```



Conclusion: Based on the given answer, the image shows a graph with three distinct clusters, each having a central node (0, 14, 6) connected with surrounding peripheral nodes (1,2,3,8,9,10,11, 12,13,14,15, 4,5,6,7). The pattern type is identified as 'star'.
