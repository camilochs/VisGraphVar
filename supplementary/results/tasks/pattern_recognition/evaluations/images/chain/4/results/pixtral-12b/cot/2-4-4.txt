   "analysis": "The graph consists of nodes connected in a continuous sequence, forming chains. Here's the breakdown of the patterns identified:

   Step 1: Observing the structure, we notice distinct clusters of connected nodes.
   Step 2: Each cluster of nodes is interconnected in a linear fashion with no branching, which typically characterizes a 'chain' pattern rather than a 'clique' (fully interconnected) or 'star' (central node with peripheral nodes) pattern.
   Step 3: Counting the clusters, we identified the following sequences:
      - Cluster 1: Nodes [0, 1, 2, 3]
      - Cluster 2: Nodes [7, 8, 5, 4]
      - Cluster 3: Nodes [12, 13, 14, 15]
      - Cluster 4: Nodes [8, 9, 10, 11]
   Step 4: Since all clusters fit the 'chain' pattern criteria, we conclude there are four such patterns in the graph.
