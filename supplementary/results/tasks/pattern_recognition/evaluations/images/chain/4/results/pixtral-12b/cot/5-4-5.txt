   - The graph consists of several clusters of nodes.
   - Each of these clusters forms a continuous sequence where each node is connected to exactly two other nodes, indicating a 'chain' pattern.
   - specifically, there are four distinct chains:
        - 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4
        - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9
        - 10 - 11 - 12 - 13 - 14
        - 15 - 16 - 17 - 18 - 19
   - These chains do not share any nodes, each chain is isolated from the others.
   - Hence, the pattern identified is 'chain' and there are four occurrences of such patterns in the graph."
