   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct chain patterns. Each chain consists of nodes connected in a linear sequence where each node (except endpoints) connects to exactly two other nodes. The chains are: (11-10-9-8), (4-5-6-7), (15-14-13-12), and (3-2-1-0). This is characteristic of chain patterns where vertices are connected in a sequential manner without any branches or circular connections."
