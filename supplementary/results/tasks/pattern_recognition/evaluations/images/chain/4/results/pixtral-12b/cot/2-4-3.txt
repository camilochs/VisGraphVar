    2. In each group, nodes are connected in a linear sequence, lacking additional secondary connections within the group (no additional interconnections between nodes apart from the main chain).\n
    3. The first chain consists of nodes 9, 10, and 11.\n
    4. The second chain includes nodes 5, 4, and 3.\n
    5. The third chain comprises nodes 0, 1, and 2.\n
    6. The fourth chain spans nodes 8, 7, and 6.\n
    7. Each chain does not include any other type of connectivity pattern such as a clique or star."
