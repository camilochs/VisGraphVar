Unfortunately, I'm a large language model, I don't have the capability to visually analyze images or access external data. However, I can guide how one would analyze an image and provide a response in the required JSON format if the image features were described. 

**Pattern Analysis:**

Assuming the image is a simple graph with nodes and edges, we can attempt to identify the pattern type based on common graph patterns. 

*   **Chain Pattern:** A chain pattern consists of nodes connected in a linear sequence, where each node has a degree of 2 (two edges), except for the first and last nodes which have a degree of 1.

*   **Clique Pattern:** A clique pattern is a complete subgraph where all nodes are connected to each other. In other words, every node in the clique is adjacent to every other node.

*   **Star Pattern:** A star pattern features a central node connected to multiple other nodes, which do not connect to each other. The central node has a high degree, while the other nodes have a degree of 1.

To accurately identify the pattern in the provided image, the features needed to be analyzed. Since this wasn't possible, I've provided a hypothetical example below:

**Hypothetical Example:**

Suppose the provided image is a simple graph with five nodes (A, B, C, D, E) and four edges (A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E). Upon analyzing the edges and nodes, we find that each node has a degree of 2, except for the first node (A) and the last node (E), which have a degree of 1. This suggests a chain-like structure.

**Response (if the image was a chain pattern):**

```json
{
   "pattern": "chain",
   "number_of_patterns": 1,
   "analysis": "The graph features a linear sequence of nodes with degrees 2 and 1 at the ends, indicating a chain pattern."
}
```

Keep in mind that this analysis is purely hypothetical, as the actual pattern in the image cannot be determined without access to the image itself.
