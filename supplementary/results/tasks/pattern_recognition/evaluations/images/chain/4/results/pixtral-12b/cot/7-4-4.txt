    1. The cluster on the left side, containing nodes labeled 4, 5, 6, and 7, arranged in a vertical line.\n 
    2. The cluster on the bottom left, containing nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3, also arranged in a vertical line but starting from the bottom.\n 
    3. The cluster on the top right, containing nodes labeled 8, 9, and 10, arranged horizontally to form another chain.\n 
    4. The cluster on the bottom right, containing nodes labeled 12, 13, 14, and 15, arranged similarly in a vertical line from bottom to top.\n 
    Each node in these chains is linked linearly, forming an unbroken sequence."
