The graph image shows four distinct clusters with the following nodes: 9-10-11, 1-2-0, 4-5-3, and the solo node 6-7-8. 

After a careful observation of these clusters, it becomes apparent that the group {6, 7, 8} is the only perfect cluster in the graph. However, upon closer inspection of the remaining clusters, we can see that both 9-10-11 and 1-0-2 and also 4-5-3 clusters partially fit the chain pattern since each cluster has three nodes and each node is connected to only two neighboring nodes.

In conclusion, only one complete chain cluster exists in this graph. Additionally, the {9, 10, 11} and {1, 0, 2} and also the {4, 5, 3} clusters exhibit behaviors that partially resemble a chain pattern symbol as a result of their similarity to linear chains.

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1],
   'analysis': 'The image demonstrates a perfect chain pattern in the {6, 7, 8} cluster, along with partial chain behaviors among the {9, 10, 11}, {1, 0, 2} and the {4, 5, 3} clusters. Additionally, it also partially demonstrates the chain pattern, although not perfectly, in contrast to the bottom left cluster {6, 7, 8}. Since only one complete cluster exhibits perfect chaining behavior, the number_of_patterns variable will be set to 1.'
