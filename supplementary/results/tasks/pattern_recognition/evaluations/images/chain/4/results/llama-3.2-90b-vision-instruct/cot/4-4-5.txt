Based on the image, I observe that the nodes are connected in a series of sequences with no branching. Each node is connected to two other nodes, except for the first and last node of each sequence which are only connected to one node.

I identify this pattern as a 'chain' since the nodes form a continuous sequence, and there is no branching or isolated nodes. I count three instances of this pattern in the image.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The nodes in the image form a continuous sequence, indicating a chain pattern.\   There is no branching, and all nodes, except the first and last in each sequence, are connected to exactly two other nodes.

}
