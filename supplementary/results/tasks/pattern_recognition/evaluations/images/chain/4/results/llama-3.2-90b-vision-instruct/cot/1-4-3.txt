**Property to Determine:** Pattern type in the graph.

**Relevant Data:**

* Nodes are labeled 0 through 11.
* Connections exist between certain pairs of nodes.

**Analysis:**

Upon examining the graph, we observe that there are no continuous sequences (chains) or fully interconnected groups (cliques) involving all nodes. Additionally, there isn't a central node directly connected to all peripheral nodes, which would indicate a 'star' pattern.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that each group of nodes constitutes a 'star' pattern. For instance, Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0 and 2, forming a small star cluster. Similarly, Node 3 is connected to Nodes 4 and 5, and Node 6 is connected to Nodes 7 and 8, each forming their own 'star' pattern. Node 9 is connected to Node 10 and 11, also forming a 'star'.

**Conclusion:**

Given the presence of multiple small 'star' patterns throughout the graph, where each central node is surrounded by a few peripheral nodes, we identify the overall pattern type as 'star'. The total count of these 'star' patterns within the graph is 4.
