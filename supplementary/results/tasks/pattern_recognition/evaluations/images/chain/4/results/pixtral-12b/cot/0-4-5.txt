Based on the analysis of the graph image, here is the detailed pattern identification:

```json
{
   'pattern': ["chain"],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': "To identify the pattern, follow these steps: 

1. **Observe the Structure:**
   - The graph has several distinct groupings of nodes.
   - Each grouping either forms a sequence or a distinct cluster.

2. **Determine if Patterns Exist:**
   - Upon closer inspection, the primary structure seen in the graph is a linear sequence of nodes.
   - These sequences form what is known as 'chains,' where each node is connected in a continuous linear pattern.
   - Specifically, look at the following clusters: 
     - (0, 1, 2, 3, 4),
     - (10, 11, 12, 13, 14),
     - (15, 16, 17, 18, 19),
     - (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

3. **Count the Instances:**
   - There are 4 distinct clusters that show a linear or chain pattern, where each node follows the next sequentially.

4. **Explanation:**
   - Each node within a specific cluster is connected linearly without breaks or deviations.
   - There are no other structures like cliques (fully interconnected groups) or stars (a central node connecting to others) evident in the graph.
   - That means all node groupings can be categorized effectively under a single pattern type: 'chain'.
