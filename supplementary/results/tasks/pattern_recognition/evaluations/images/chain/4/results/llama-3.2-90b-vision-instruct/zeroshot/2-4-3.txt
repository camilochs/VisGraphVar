**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

Given the graph image, I have identified the underlying pattern present in it.

**Pattern Type:** `chain`

Based on the provided graph image, I have detected a single pattern of type "chain". The sequence representing this pattern is 9, 10, 11, where each number corresponds to a node in the graph.

**Number of Patterns:** `1`

In the given graph, I have identified a single chain pattern. No other patterns, such as clique or star, are present.

**Analysis:**

The graph image reveals a clear sequence of nodes connected in a linear fashion. Each node has only two edges, one incoming and one outgoing, forming a continuous chain. There are no branches or cycles in the graph, indicating that the sole pattern present is a chain. The sequence representing this pattern is 9, 10, 11.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the graph image contains a single chain pattern with a sequence of 9, 10, 11. This pattern is characterized by a linear sequence of nodes with no branches or cycles.
