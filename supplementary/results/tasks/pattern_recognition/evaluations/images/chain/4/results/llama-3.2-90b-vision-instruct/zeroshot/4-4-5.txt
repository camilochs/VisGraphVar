**Analysis of the Given Graph Image**

Based on the graph image provided, we will analyze its structure and identify the pattern it contains.

**Identifying the Pattern**

Upon examining the graph, we observe that some of its features are in line with the definition of a chain pattern. A chain pattern consists of vertices (V) and edges (E), where each vertex is connected to only one or two other vertices. Similarly, in the graph, we find a chain pattern.

**Counting the Number of Patterns**

After carefully reviewing the structure, we can identify two distinct chain patterns within the graph image.

**Conclusion**

Based on our analysis, we conclude that the graph image contains a chain pattern. Therefore, the output of our analysis is as follows:

```json
{
    "pattern": "chain",
    "number_of_patterns": 2,
    "analysis": "The graph image contains a chain pattern, where each vertex links to one or two other vertices."
}
