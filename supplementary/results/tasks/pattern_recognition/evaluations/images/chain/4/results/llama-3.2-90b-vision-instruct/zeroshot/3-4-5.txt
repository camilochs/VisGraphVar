**Step 1: Examine the Graph Image**

The graph contains nodes labeled with numbers from 0 to 19, connected by lines representing edges.

**Step 2: Define the Patterns**

*   **Chain:** A sequence of nodes connected in a line by edges.
*   **Clique:** A subgraph where every node is connected to every other node with an edge.
*   **Star:** A subgraph with one central node connected to other nodes, but these other nodes are not connected to each other.

**Step 3: Analyze the Graph**

Upon inspection:

*   There are several sequences of connected nodes (13-12-11-10, 16-15-14, 17-18-19) showing chain patterns.
*   No cliques exist because not all nodes are connected to each other directly.
*   Some nodes act as central hubs, connecting multiple other nodes (such as 7 linking 5, 6, 8, and 9), resembling star patterns.

**Step 4: Count the Patterns**

*   **Chain:** At least three independent sequences are observed.
*   **Star:** At least one central node connecting multiple other nodes is present.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

The graph shows multiple 'chain' and at least one 'star' pattern but no 'clique' patterns.

**Answer:**

```json
{
    "pattern": ["chain", "star"],
    "number_of_patterns": [3, 1],
    "analysis": "The appearance of nodes in sequential lines indicates chains, and nodes acting as hubs suggest star patterns."
}
