**Answer:** 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': 'The graph is composed of four distinct chains. Each chain consists of a series of nodes that are sequentially connected, forming a linear sequence. The chains are separate from one another, with no nodes in one chain connected to any node from another chain.'
}
```

In this response, the pattern type is identified as a 'chain,' reflecting the linear, sequential connections among nodes within each separate cluster. The number of patterns of this type is counted as 4, corresponding to the four visually distinct clusters in the graph. The analysis explains that each cluster represents a chain due to their sequential connections, and these chains are isolated from one another.
