Based on analyzing the provided graph image, here is the JSON format detailing the pattern types:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'To determine the pattern types from the graph image, follow these steps:

   1. Observe the structure of the graph:
      - The graph consists of four distinct clusters each containing linked nodes.

   2. Identify the patterns:
      - Each cluster has nodes connected in a linear fashion where each successive node is directly linked to the next. This is characteristic of a “chain” pattern where nodes are connected in a continuous sequence.

   3. Count the instances of the identified pattern:
      - There are four separate clusters, each following the “chain” pattern.

   4. Reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes:
      - The graphs are visually characterized by a single line following from one node to the next in a continuous sequence without branching.

      Therefore, the consistent pattern seen in the clusters is the “chain” pattern. The nodes in each cluster are directly connected one after another forming a linear configuration.'
