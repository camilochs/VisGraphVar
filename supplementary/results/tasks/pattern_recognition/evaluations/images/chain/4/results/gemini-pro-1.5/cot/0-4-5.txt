  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct sets of nodes. Each set forms a chain where nodes are connected sequentially. Chain 1: 0-1-2-3-4. Chain 2: 5-6-7-8-9. Chain 3: 10-11-12-13-14. Chain 4: 15-16-17-18-19.  Therefore, the identified pattern is 'chain', and there are four such patterns."
