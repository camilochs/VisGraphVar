**Graph Pattern Identification**

Based on the graph image, the identified pattern is a 'chain' of nodes. The justification for this response lies in the structure and interconnectedness of the nodes, which form a sequence without isolated components.

**Solution**: The final answer is:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'chain',
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of four distinct chains of nodes, each linked in a sequence. There are no fully interconnected groups or central nodes with peripheral ones, characteristic of cliques or stars, respectively.'
}
```

This analysis indicates that the graph's structure is classified as a 'chain' pattern due to the sequential connection of nodes without any cliques (fully interconnected groups) or stars (central nodes with surrounding nodes).
