**Pattern Analysis:**

To identify the type of pattern in the given graph, we need to analyze its structure.

**Graph Structure:**

The graph consists of multiple connected nodes with no isolated vertices. Each node is connected to at least one other node.

**Pattern Types:**

- **Chain:** A chain is a sequence of nodes where each node is connected to exactly two other nodes, one preceding it and one succeeding it. This creates a linear sequence.
- **Clique:** A clique is a subset of nodes where every node is connected to every other node within the subset. This forms a complete subgraph.
- **Star:** A star pattern involves one central node connected to multiple other nodes, each of which is not connected to any other node besides the central one.

**Analysis:**

Upon examining the graph, it's clear that the connections between nodes do not form a linear sequence (chain), nor do they connect every node to every other node within a subset (clique). However, there are instances where one node is connected to multiple other nodes, each of which is not connected to any other node besides the central one. This matches the definition of a star pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Given the presence of central nodes connected to several others with no interconnections among those others, the pattern in the graph is identified as a 'star.' There are multiple occurrences of this pattern as each central node with its adjacent, unconnected nodes constitutes a star pattern.

**Final Answer:** 

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'The presence of central nodes connected to multiple other nodes without any interconnections among them indicates a star pattern. Multiple instances of such configurations are observed in the graph.'
}
