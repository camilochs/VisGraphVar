To analyze the graph image, we'll follow the prescribed steps.

Observing the graph, we note the following clusters:
1. Top-left cluster: Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15 arranged in a sequence.
2. Top-right cluster: Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11 arranged in a sequence.
3. Bottom-left cluster: Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7 arranged in a sequence.
4. Bottom-right cluster: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 forming a cluster that can be viewed as connecting sequentially or as a small clique.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. **Top-left cluster**: Nodes 12 to 15 are connected in a linear sequence, indicating a 'chain' pattern.
2. **Top-right cluster**: Nodes 8 to 11 are connected in a linear sequence, indicating another 'chain' pattern.
3. **Bottom-left cluster**: Nodes 4 to 7 are connected in a linear sequence, suggesting yet another 'chain' pattern.
4. **Bottom-right cluster**: Here, node 1 is connected to node 2, node 2 to node 3, and node 1 also to node 0. This could be viewed as a chain between nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, but we also see fully interconnected elements (nodes 1, 2, 3). This could briefly suggest the presence of a 'clique' within the two sequences, but it doesn't fully comply due to the additional connection sequence.

Based on the above, the prevalent pattern type can be identified.

   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": 4,
   "analysis": "By observing the graph, we see distinct sequences of connected nodes without interconnections in different directions. There are four sequences present: top-left (nodes 12 to 15), top-right (nodes 8 to 11), bottom-left (nodes 4 to 7), and bottom-right (nodes 0, 1, 2, 3). Each sequence forms a linear sequence, and none of the nodes are fully interconnected to form a clique or star. Thus, all groups are linear 'chains'."
