After analyzing the graph image, let's identify the pattern type and count how many instances of each pattern are present.

### Analysis:
1. **Observation of the structure:**
   - The graph contains four distinct groups of nodes.

2. **Identification of patterns:**
   - The first group (nodes 10-11) involves nodes 10 and 11 connected together in a pair.
   - The second group (nodes 12-15) involves nodes 12, 13, and 14 forming a chain connected in a row with node 15 off to the side connected to 14.
   - The third group (nodes 1-3) involves nodes 1, 2, and 3 in a continuous line.
   - The fourth group (nodes 4-7) involves nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 forming a continuous line with no isolated nodes.

3. **Determination of the pattern type:**
   - **Chain Pattern:** Groups 2 (nodes 12-14) and 3 (nodes 1-3) fit the chain pattern as nodes are interconnected linearly.
   - **Clique Pattern:** Group 4 (nodes 4-7) fits the clique pattern as nodes are fully interconnected without isolated nodes.
   - **Pair Pattern:** Group 1 (nodes 10-11) can be considered a special simple chain or a minimal clique.

### Counting Instances:
- Chain Pattern: 2 instances (nodes 12-14 and nodes 1-3).
- Clique Pattern: 1 instance (nodes 4-7).
- Pair Pattern: 1 instance (nodes 10-11).

### Explanation:
1. **Chain Pattern Analysis:** 
   - **Groups 2 and 3** show nodes directly connected in continuous sequences.
2. **Clique Pattern Analysis:**
   - **Group 4** includes all nodes interconnected, indicating a fully connected, or complete, set.

### Conclusion:
- There are 2 instances of the chain pattern.
- There is 1 instance of the clique pattern.
- There is 1 instance of the pair pattern.
