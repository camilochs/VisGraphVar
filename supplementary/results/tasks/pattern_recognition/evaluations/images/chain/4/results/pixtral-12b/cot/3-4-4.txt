To identify the pattern type in the given graph, let's follow the steps mentioned:

1. **Observation of the Structure:**
   The image shows four distinct clusters of nodes.

2. **Pattern Identification:**
   We need to examine the connections among the nodes within each cluster:
   - **First Cluster (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3):** 
     Nodes are linearly connected, forming a sequence or a 'chain.'
   - **Second Cluster (Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7):**
     Nodes are also linearly connected, constituting another 'chain.'
   - **Third Cluster (Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11):**
     Nodes are linearly connected, forming another 'chain.'
   - **Fourth Cluster (Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15):**
     Nodes are linearly connected, forming yet another 'chain.'

3. **Pattern Count:**
   Each of the four clusters forms a 'chain' pattern.

4. **Explanation:**
   Upon analyzing the connections, we see that each cluster follows a sequential (chain) pattern. In a chain, nodes are connected linearly, without any branching until the next node.

Given this analysis, our response in JSON format will be as follows:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": 4,
   "analysis": [
       "Step 1: Analyze the graph structure to identify distinct clusters.",
       "Step 2: Identify the type of connectivity within each cluster. The clusters in this graph are linearly connected, forming a sequence.",
       "Step 3: Count the number of such sequential clusters.",
       "Conclusion: All four clusters exhibit a 'chain' pattern."
    ]
}
