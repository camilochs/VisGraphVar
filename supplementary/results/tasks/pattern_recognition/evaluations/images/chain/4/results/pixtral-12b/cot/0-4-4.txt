The first cluster on the top left appears to be a 'star' with node 0 as the central node and nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11 as peripheral nodes.\n2. The second cluster on the right also appears to be a 'chain' with nodes 1, 2, and 3 in a continuous sequence.\n3. The third cluster on the bottom left is another 'chain' with nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15 in a continuous sequence.\n4. The last cluster on the bottom right forms a 'chain' with nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 in a continuous sequence.\n\nStep 3: Count the instances of each pattern type.\n\nStep 4: Reasoning:\n1. A star pattern is evident in the first and fourth clusters.\n2. A chain pattern is evident in the second and third clusters and in the fourth cluster.\nThus, we have 3 pattern instances: two stars and one chain."
