   "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct linear chains of nodes. Each chain is formed by nodes connected in a continuous sequence, without any branching or overlapping. Chain 1 includes nodes 0-3, Chain 2 includes nodes 4-7, Chain 3 includes nodes 8-11, and Chain 4 includes nodes 12-15. This analysis confirms that the only pattern type present in the graph is 'chain'."
