**Pattern Analysis**

After analyzing the graph, we can identify the following pattern:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains three distinct chains, each consisting of three vertices connected by edges. The chains are separate and do not intersect with each other.'
}
```

This conclusion is based on the visual inspection of the graph, which reveals three distinct groups of three vertices connected by edges, forming chain-like structures. These chains are isolated from each other, indicating that they are separate patterns within the graph.
