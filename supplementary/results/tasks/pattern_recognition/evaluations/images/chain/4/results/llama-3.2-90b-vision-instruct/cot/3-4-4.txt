**Step 1: Analyzing and Identifying Patterns in the Graph**

The graph can be divided into four groups:

1. Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 from the group
2. Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 from the group
3. Nodes 9, 10, and 11 from the group
4. Nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15 from the group

**Step 2: Observing Structure and Identifying Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**

Looking at the graph, the arrangement resembles nested while-linked loops, which is indicative of a **chain** pattern. The connections between nodes seem linear and sequential rather than being fully interconnected or radiating from a central node.

**Step 3: Counting Instances of Each Pattern**

There are **four** instances of the **chain** pattern in the graph.

**Step 4: Calculating the Number of Patterns in Each Instance**

Each chain pattern has a distinct sequence of nodes:

* The first instance includes nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 in a linear connection.
* The second instance comprises nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7, also forming a straight line.
* The third instance consists of nodes 9, 10, and 11, maintaining the sequential connection.
* The fourth instance involves nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15, continuing the chain pattern.

**Conclusion**

Given the observations and analysis, the graph exhibits a **chain** pattern with **four** distinct instances. Each instance displays a linear connection among its nodes, characteristic of a chain pattern.
