**Answer:**

```json
{
  'pattern': 'chain',
  'number_of_patterns': 4,
  'analysis': 'The graph consists of four distinct clusters, each maintaining a sequential chain-like pattern. I observed that the central node 1 in the first cluster connects its node 0 without including other nodes in that specific box, characteristic of the "chain" pattern. Observations also confirmed other nodes spread across three different boxes maintain a sequential order. From cluster 1, with the central node 1 and node 0, to cluster 2 with central node 9, 10, and 11; cluster 3 with central node 5, and last cluster 4 with central node 6 and 7, all exhibited the "chain" structure.
The group relation and interconnectivity among nodes informed the decision to identify the "chain" pattern instead of the "clique" pattern due to the lack of total interconnectivity between all nodes, and instead of the "star" pattern because of the linear-like sequencing and general lack of central nodes in sequentially ordered fashion in the other remaining three clusters, creating complex structures.
Further verifying the count of four distinct cluster chains within the graph image, all regular vacillations are consistent with the logical rule.'

```

**Explanation:**

The graph image shows four distinct clusters, each maintaining a sequential chain-like pattern. The first cluster, with the central node 1 connecting to node 0, is the starting point for the chain pattern. The second cluster, with central node 9, 10, and 11, also maintains the chain pattern.

The third cluster, with central node 5, and the fourth cluster, with central node 6 and 7, also exhibit the chain structure. The group relation and interconnectivity among nodes informed the decision to identify the "chain" pattern instead of the "clique" pattern due to the lack of total interconnectivity between all nodes, and instead of the "star" pattern because of the linear-like sequencing and general lack of central nodes in sequentially ordered fashion in the other remaining three clusters, creating complex structures.

Therefore, the identified pattern type is "chain", and the total count of this pattern type in the image is 4.
