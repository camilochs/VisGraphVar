   "chain" patterns form linear sequences with nodes connected in a sequence. 
   There are four such patterns. Examples include sequences 
   [0-4] and [10-14]. 
   "star" patterns have a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. 
   There is one such pattern, example [5-9]. 
   "clique" patterns are fully connected subgraphs where all nodes are connected to each other. 
   There is one such pattern, example [15-19].'
