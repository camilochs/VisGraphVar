   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct chain patterns: 1) A chain of nodes 12-13-14-15, 2) A chain of nodes 8-9-10-11, and 3) A chain of nodes 7-6-5-4. Each of these sequences shows nodes connected in a linear fashion where each node (except endpoints) connects to exactly two other nodes. The remaining nodes (0,1,2,3) form a small connected component but don't clearly fit into a chain, clique, or star pattern. The chains are easily identifiable by their linear arrangement and sequential connections, making 'chain' the predominant pattern type in this graph."
