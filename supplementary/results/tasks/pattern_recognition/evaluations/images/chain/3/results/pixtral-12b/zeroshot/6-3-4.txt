Based on the given graph image, here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains two distinct patterns: two chains and one star. The first chain consists of nodes {0, 1, 2, 3}, where each node is connected sequentially, indicating a linear arrangement. The second chain is composed of nodes {4, 5, 6, 7} in a similar linear formation. Additionally, there is a star pattern centered around node 11, with nodes {8, 9, 10} connected directly to it, representing a structure where one central node links to multiple peripheral nodes.'
