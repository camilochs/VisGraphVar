**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

Given the graph image, after a systematic examination, it appears to exhibit a pattern that closely resembles a **star**.

**Key Observations:**

*   The graph features central nodes surrounded by connected peripheral nodes.
*   Each peripheral node is connected to the central node, but not directly to other peripheral nodes within the same star subgraph.
*   There are at least two distinct stars in the graph, as indicated by separate central nodes with their respective peripheral nodes.

**Conclusion**

Based on these observations, the graph image contains a **star pattern**. Specifically, there are **two instances** of this pattern evident.

**Response in JSON Format:**
