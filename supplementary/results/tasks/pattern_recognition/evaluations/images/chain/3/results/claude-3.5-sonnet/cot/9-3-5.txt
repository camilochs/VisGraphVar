   "analysis": "The graph clearly shows three distinct chain patterns: 1) A chain of nodes 14-13-12-11-10, 2) A chain of nodes 5-6-7-8-9, and 3) A chain of nodes 0-1-2-3-4. In each chain, the nodes are connected in a linear sequence where each node (except the endpoints) connects to exactly two other nodes. There are no circular connections or central hub nodes that would indicate clique or star patterns. The chains are isolated from each other with no cross-connections between them, making the chain pattern identification very clear."
