**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

A visual examination of the graph's topology shows three distinct groups: \[(0,1,2,3), (4,5,6,7),\] and \[(8,9,10,11)\].

**Key Observations**

Each group contains nodes connected sequentially, which is typical of the 'chain' pattern. The groups are isolated, with no interconnections between them, confirming that this is not a 'star' or 'clique' pattern.

**Conclusions**

Therefore, the pattern types are primarily chains, with no cliques or stars present. Each group constitutes one instance of a chain, leading to three such instances.

**Summary in JSON Format**

```json
{
    "pattern": ["chain"],
    "number_of_patterns": 3,
    "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct groups linked in a continuous sequence. These are individual chains, confirming the presence of the 'chain' pattern type."
}
```

A more detailed analysis would require more specific information about the edges' direction or absence of direction, as these factors play a crucial role in defining the properties of a graph, beyond the topology observed.
