**Step 1: Identify the pattern type.**

The graph consists of three disconnected clusters, each with a distinct structure. The first cluster (top right) is a chain, connecting nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 in a linear sequence. The second cluster (middle) is also a chain, linking nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7. The third cluster (bottom left) exhibits a slightly different arrangement, with nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11 showcasing an additional connection between node 9 and node 10.

**Step 2: Determine the number of patterns.**

There are two instances of chains and one instance of a unique cluster. However, since the unique cluster does not conform to the standard definitions of a chain, clique, or star, it cannot be classified under these categories.

**Step 3: Explain the reasoning.**

The reasoning behind this analysis lies in the visual inspection of the graph's layout and the relationships among its nodes. The identification of chains is based on the linear, consecutive connections between nodes, while the unique cluster's failure to fit standard pattern definitions necessitates its exclusion from the final tally.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2],
   'analysis': 'Two chain patterns are observed in the graph image, consisting of linear connections between nodes without any isolated nodes or a central node with peripheral connections.'
}
