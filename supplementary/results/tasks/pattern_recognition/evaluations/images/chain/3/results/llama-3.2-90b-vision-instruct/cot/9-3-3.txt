**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph image, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Clusters and Links**: The graph shows three distinct clusters or components that are not interconnected with each other. Each cluster consists of nodes linked together.

2. **Determine Pattern Type**:
   - **Chain**: A sequence of nodes connected one after another. This does not fit well as the clusters have more than two nodes and show a mix of lines indicating connections beyond just sequential linking.
   - **Clique**: All nodes in a group are connected to every other node. This seems plausible for at least one cluster but needs further examination for all groups.
   - **Star**: A central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes with no connections between those peripherals. This could potentially describe some of the clusters, especially considering the centrality observed in the smaller clusters.

3. **Count Instances**:
   - Upon closer inspection, both larger clusters resemble stars more than chains or cliques due to their centrality. The smaller cluster could be argued as either a star or a chain due to its simplicity and lack of additional connections, but given its structure, it leans more towards a star if considering the one node that is central.

**Conclusion**:

*   {
*       "pattern": ["star"],
*       "number_of_patterns": 3,
*       "analysis": "The graph exhibits a 'star' pattern in each of its three distinct clusters. Each cluster has a central node connected to peripheral nodes without those peripherals being interconnected among themselves, fitting the definition of a star pattern."
*   }

This analysis suggests that the graph image primarily shows instances of the star pattern across its three main clusters.
