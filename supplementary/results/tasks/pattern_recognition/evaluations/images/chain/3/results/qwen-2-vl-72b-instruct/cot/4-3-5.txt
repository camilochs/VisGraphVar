   "analysis": "The graph contains four distinct patterns: a 'chain' pattern where nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence, a 'star' pattern where a central node has surrounding peripheral nodes, a 'clique' pattern where all nodes are fully interconnected, and a 'center-node' pattern where a central node is surrounded by isolates. Each pattern is represented once in the graph."
