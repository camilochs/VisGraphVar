**Step 1: Identify the pattern in the graph image.**

The graph contains nodes that are connected to form a single chain, resembling a chain-like structure.

**Step 2: Check for characteristics of a 'chain' in the graph.**

The nodes appear in the chain as follows: node 14 is connected to node 13, which is connected to node 12, and this pattern continues.

**Step 3: Conclude the answer.**

Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the graph belongs to the 'chain' pattern.
```json
{
 'pattern': "chain",
 'number_of_patterns': 1,
 'analysis': "The graph has nodes that appear in the pattern of a single chain."
}
```
Final Answer: The final answer is as above. I hope it is correct.
