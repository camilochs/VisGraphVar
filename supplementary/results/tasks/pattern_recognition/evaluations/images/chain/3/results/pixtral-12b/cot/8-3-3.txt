The graph image features nodes connected by edges and can be analyzed to identify the pattern types. Let's proceed with the steps mentioned:

1. **Observe the structure and identify clusters**:
   - There are four distinct clusters of nodes, connected linearly within each cluster.

2. **Determine the pattern type for each cluster**:
   - The first cluster includes the nodes 0, 1, and 2.
   - The second cluster includes the nodes 6, 7, and 8.
   - The third cluster includes the nodes 4, 3, and 5.

3. **Review the structure of each cluster**:
   - Each of these clusters forms a "chain" pattern, where the nodes are interconnected linearly.
   
4. **Explain the reasoning**:
   - Nodes 0, 1, and 2 are connected in a sequence (0->1->2). 
   - Nodes 6, 7, and 8 are connected in a sequence (6->7->8).
   - Nodes 4, 3, and 5 are connected in a sequence (4->3->5).

Based on the above analysis, the pattern type observed in the image is 'chain.'
