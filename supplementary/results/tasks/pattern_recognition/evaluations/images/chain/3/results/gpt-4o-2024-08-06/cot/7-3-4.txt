Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 form a chain connected sequentially. \n2. Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 form another chain, also connected sequentially. \n3. Nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11 form a third chain, connected consecutively. \nNone of the groups form a star or a fully connected clique. All patterns in the graph are linear chains."
