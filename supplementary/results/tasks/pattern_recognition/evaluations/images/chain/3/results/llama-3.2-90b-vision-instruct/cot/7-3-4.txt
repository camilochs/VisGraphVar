I'm not able to analyze an image or view visual content. However, I can guide you through the steps to identify the pattern type in a graph image.

Here is the response in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'Unable to identify',
   'number_of_patterns': '0',
   'analysis': 'No image was provided for analysis.'
}
```

To accurately identify the pattern type, please provide the graph image or describe its layout and relationships among nodes.
