**Pattern Analysis**

After carefully examining the graph, the identified pattern type is a 'chain'. The reasoning behind this classification is as follows:

*   The graph consists of three distinct groups of nodes: one group with nodes 0-2, another with nodes 3-5, and the last with nodes 6-8.
*   Within each group, the nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence.
*   Specifically:
    *   Nodes 0-1-2 form a chain.
    *   Nodes 3-4-5 form another chain.
    *   Nodes 6-7-8 constitute a third chain.
*   There are no isolated nodes or cliques present in the graph.

**Conclusion**

Based on the observed structure, the graph features three instances of the 'chain' pattern. This conclusion is supported by the layout and relationships among the nodes, which clearly demonstrate a chain-like sequence within each identified group.
