I am not able to analyze visual data or access any images. In order to give more detailed information regarding the graph you would need to provide a description of the layout and contents of the image. However, below is a response that could be provided if more information were available.

```json
{
    'pattern': 'star',
    'number_of_patterns': 2,
    'analysis': 'The graph appears to have two distinct clusters, each with a central node that connects to a surrounding set of peripheral nodes. The central node in each cluster shows no connection to the nodes of the other cluster. This, in addition to no peripheral node in either being connected to any other peripheral node, indicates the presence of two star patterns.'
}
```
To provide more accurate information for any given image, please provide a description of the nodes and their connections within the image.
