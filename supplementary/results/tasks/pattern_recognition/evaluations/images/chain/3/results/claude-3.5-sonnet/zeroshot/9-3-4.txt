    "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct chain patterns. Each chain is characterized by nodes connected in a linear sequence with no branching or cycles. The first chain consists of nodes 11-10-9-8, the second chain has nodes 4-5-6-7, and the third chain contains nodes 0-1-2-3. Each node in these sequences is connected only to its adjacent nodes, forming clear chain patterns."
