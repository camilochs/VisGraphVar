   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct chain patterns. One chain consists of nodes 0-1-2-3-4, another chain contains nodes 5-6-7-8-9, and the third chain includes nodes 10-11-12-13-14. Each chain is characterized by nodes connected in a linear sequence where each node (except endpoints) has exactly two neighbors."
