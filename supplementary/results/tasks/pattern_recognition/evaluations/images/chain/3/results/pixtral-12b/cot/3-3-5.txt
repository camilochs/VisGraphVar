   "analysis": "Firstly, I observed the graph structure and identified three distinct clusters or groups of nodes. Each cluster forms a linear sequence, which appears to be a continuous chain-like pattern.

   - The first cluster consists of nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, all connected in a continuous line, indicative of a chain.
   - The second cluster contains nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4, connected in sequence, forming another chain.
   - The third cluster includes nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, also connected in a linear sequence like a chain.

   There are no instances of fully interconnected or clique patterns where all nodes within a cluster are connected, and no central node with surrounding peripheral nodes indicating star patterns. Therefore, the identified pattern type is 'chain' based on the layout and relationships among nodes."
