Each subgraph is an independent isolated cluster of nodes connected in a chain-like manner. The first subgraph contains nodes 7, 6, 5, and 4. The second subgraph consists of nodes 3, 2, 1, and 0. The third subgraph includes nodes 10, 11, 9, and 8. These subgraphs are not interconnected, thereby representing independent clusters.'
