**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the type of pattern in the given graph, we analyze its structure and connectivity.

**Step 1: Identify Graph Structure**
- The graph consists of nodes and edges between them.
- There are no isolated nodes (nodes without connections).

**Step 2: Determine Connectivity**
- All nodes are connected in a linear sequence.
- Each node is connected to only two others, one in each direction except for the two endpoints.

**Conclusion**
Based on the linear sequence of connectivity and each node being connected only to its immediate neighbors, this pattern is identified as a "chain." Since there is only one chain connecting all nodes sequentially without any branches or clusters, the number of patterns is one.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1],
   'analysis': 'The graph shows a linear sequence where each node is connected to exactly two neighbors, forming a single chain across the graph.'
