To determine the type of pattern in the graph, let's analyze its structure. The graph consists of three disconnected subgraphs: one with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3; another with nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7; and a third with nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11.

- Each subgraph is linear, meaning each node is connected only to immediate neighbors along a single line.
- There are no branches where one node connects to more than two others, indicative of a chain pattern.
- There is no presence of either all nodes being connected to all other nodes (which would be a clique) or one central node connected to all others (indicative of a star pattern).

Given these observations, the pattern that fits this description is a "chain" pattern because each subgraph shows a straight line connection between nodes without any branching or central connecting node.

   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph shows three linear chains of nodes without any branching or central node, fitting the definition of a chain pattern.'
