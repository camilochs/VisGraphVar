**Pattern Recognition Steps:**

1. **Cluster Identification:** The graph image consists of three distinct clusters or groups of interconnected nodes.
2. **Node Connectivity Analysis:**
   - The first cluster (top-left) connects nodes 11, 10, 9, and 8 in a sequential manner, indicating a chain-like structure.
   - The second cluster (bottom-left) links nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 in a similar sequential fashion, suggesting another chain.
   - The third cluster (bottom-right) connects nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 sequentially, pointing towards a chain pattern as well.
3. **Counting Instances:** Based on the sequential connectivity without isolated nodes or full interconnection between all nodes within each cluster, all three groups represent a 'chain' pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Given the step-by-step analysis focusing on the structure and connectivity among nodes, the identified pattern type is a 'chain,' with a total of three instances across the graph image. Each cluster forms a chain due to their sequential interconnection without showing characteristics of a clique (all nodes interconnected) or a star (central node with direct connections to surrounding nodes). The described 'chain' pattern captures this observed behavior accurately. 

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The graph displays three clusters of nodes, each sequentially connected, which defines them as chains.'
}
