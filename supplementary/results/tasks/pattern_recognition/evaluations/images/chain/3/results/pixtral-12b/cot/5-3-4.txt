To identify the pattern type in the graph, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**
   - Each node is connected linearly, forming a sequence.

2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star'):**
   - The nodes are connected in a continuous sequence without branches or loops, indicating a 'chain' pattern.

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:**
   - There are three distinct sequences or 'chains' present.

4. **Explanation of the layout and relationships among nodes:**
   - The layout reveals three linear sequences of nodes, each group forming an uninterrupted chain without branches. The relationships among nodes in each chain are straightforward linked connections from one node to the next.
