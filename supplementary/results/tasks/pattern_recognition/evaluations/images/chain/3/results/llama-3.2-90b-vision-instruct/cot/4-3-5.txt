**Pattern Analysis**

The graph displays three distinct clusters of nodes, each resembling a chain pattern. In a chain pattern, nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence without any loops or branches.

**Step 1: Identifying Clusters**
- The first cluster (to the left) consists of five nodes numbered 10 through 14, sequentially connected.
- The second cluster (at the top-right) is composed of six nodes (5, 6, 7, 8, 9), also sequentially connected.
- The third cluster (at the bottom) contains four nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), similarly connected in a sequence.

**Step 2: Pattern Identification**
Each of these clusters represents a 'chain' pattern. There are no indications of a fully interconnected clique or a central node with peripheral nodes characteristic of a star pattern.

**Step 3: Counting Instances**
By identifying three separate clusters that each follow the chain pattern, we conclude there are three instances of this pattern.

**Conclusion**
Given the connected sequences within separate parts of the graph and the absence of other pattern types, we identify the pattern type as 'chain' with three instances.

  "analysis": "The graph displays three separate clusters where each node is connected in a sequence without branches or loops, fitting the definition of a chain pattern. Since there are no signs of interconnecting all nodes (clique) or a central node with peripherals (star), and we observe three distinct sequences, we identify three chain patterns."
