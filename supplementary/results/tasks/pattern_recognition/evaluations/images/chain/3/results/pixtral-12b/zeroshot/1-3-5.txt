Based on the provided graph image, here is the analysis in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3, 1],
   'analysis': 'The graph comprises multiple types of patterns. There are three "chain" patterns where nodes are connected in linear sequences without branches: one starting from node 7 to 9, one from node 10 to 14, and one from node 4 to 0. Additionally, there is one "star" pattern where node 6 is the central node connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8. The distinct connectivity patterns indicate a varied structure within the larger graph.'
