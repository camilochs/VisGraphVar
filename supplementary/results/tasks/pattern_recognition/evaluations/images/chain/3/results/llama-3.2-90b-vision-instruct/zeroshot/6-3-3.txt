**Step 1: Identify the pattern type**

The given graph image contains a chain pattern. A chain pattern is a sequence of nodes connected by edges, where each node has a degree of two, except for the end nodes, which have a degree of one.

**Step 2: Count the number of patterns**

There is only one chain pattern in the given graph image.

**Step 3: Analyze the features**

The graph image shows a sequence of nodes connected by edges, forming a chain-like structure. Each node has a degree of two, except for the end nodes, which have a degree of one. This indicates that the graph is a chain pattern.

**Answer:**

```json
{
  "pattern": "chain",
  "number_of_patterns": 1,
  "analysis": "The graph image shows a sequence of nodes connected by edges, forming a chain-like structure. Each node has a degree of two, except for the end nodes, which have a degree of one."
}
