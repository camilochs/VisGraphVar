Based on the graph structure, I identify a single chain pattern with three segments. One segment links nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7, another segment consists of node 0 and its connected nodes 1, 2, and 3, and the third segment is composed of nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11.

Here is the JSON notation:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1],
   'analysis': 'The graph exhibits three distinct sequences of connected nodes that form the identified chain pattern.'
}
```
