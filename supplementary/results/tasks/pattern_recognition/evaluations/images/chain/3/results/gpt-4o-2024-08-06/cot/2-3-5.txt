   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct groups. Each group consists of nodes interconnected in a continuous sequence without branching or forming a fully connected network. Group 1 consists of nodes from 0 to 4 linked sequentially, Group 2 consists of nodes from 5 to 9, and Group 3 consists of nodes from 10 to 14. There are no isolated or central nodes with surrounding peripheral nodes. Thus, the identified pattern type is 'chain'."
