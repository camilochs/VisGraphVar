**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the graph, we need to examine its structure.

*   **Chain Pattern**: A chain pattern is characterized by nodes linked sequentially without any branches or forks. Each node (except the first and last) connects to exactly two other nodes, forming a straight line.
*   **Clique Pattern**: A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent; that is, its induced subgraph is a complete graph. In simpler terms, every node in a clique is directly connected to every other node in the clique.
*   **Star Pattern**: A star pattern has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, and the peripheral nodes do not connect to each other. The central node acts as a hub, while the peripheral nodes are satellites.

**Conclusion**

Given the graph image, we observe that it does not form a complete subgraph where every node connects to every other node, ruling out a clique. The graph also doesn't display a hub-and-spoke model typical of a star pattern, where one central node connects to multiple other nodes that do not interconnect. Instead, the graph shows nodes connected in sequences without forming loops or complete interconnections, characteristic of a chain pattern. Specifically, the graph exhibits multiple linear sequences of nodes, indicating multiple chain patterns are present.
