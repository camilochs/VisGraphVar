**Step 1: Identifying "chain" feature in first shape**

* After observing the first closed circuit, we can identify a chain-like feature containing the numbers [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] connected together as a continuous sequence of seven distinct nodes.

**Step 2: Identifying "chain" feature in second shape**

* Similarly, looking at the second originating circuit, another chain-like feature is identified containing distinct connecting values [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

**Step 3: Identifying "chain" feature in third shape**

* Observing the third closed circuit, another chain-like feature is identified containing the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] connected together as a continuous sequence of four distinct nodes.

**Step 4: Counting consecutive numbers**

* Phase one contains the chain [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Each contains four serial numbers (5-8 inclusive and another one 9).
* Phase two contains the chain [10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 also contains five consecutive numbers/links.
* Phase three contains the closed strip [1, 2, 3, 4] also containing four consecutive numbers/links.

**Step 5: Summing up each consecutive link**

* The number of consecutive links for the first strip is five.
* The number of consecutive links for the second chain is five.
* The number of consecutive links for the third chain is four.

**Step 6: Drawing conclusions and possible future applications**

* Depending on the scenario where we encounter three nodes (regardless of if the nodes are distinct values or not), and within seven distinct nodes, the chain pattern will emerge.
* In conclusion, since the nodes are always distinct, regardless of the number of distinct nodes (seven, five, or four), the chain pattern is always evident because inter-distinct values are always present both as connected sequences and continuities. As such, all future patterns could appear as stars and because chains of stars are possible, the **chain** pattern can be implemented, provided the nodes represent discrete values from 1 to 10. This is a scenario given that the resultant distinct values are finite to form the links as seven, five, and four, respectively. 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the pattern type is identified as "chain". Three chains (circuit patterns) are identified in the graph.
