                2. Each cluster has nodes that are interconnected in a sequential manner.
                3. The first cluster (nodes: 0 -> 1 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4) forms a continuous sequence, bordered by terminal nodes.
                4. The second cluster (nodes: 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11) forms another continuous sequence, also bordered by terminal nodes.
                5. These patterns demonstrate a 'chain' type pattern, repeated twice across the graph. 
                6. The total count of this pattern type in the image is 2.
