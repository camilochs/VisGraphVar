**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the graph, we will examine its structure and node connections.

**Observations:**

* The graph consists of three distinct sections, each having a central node.
* Each of these sections connects to other nodes extending further outward.
* These extended connections do not loop back or connect with each other outside of their respective central nodes.
* Connections between nodes do not form a unbroken sequence that loops back to itself.
* All nodes are not interconnected without any isolated or non-central nodes.

**Pattern Recognition:**

Based on our observations, this pattern aligns with a "star" pattern. A star pattern is defined by a central node with direct links to all other nodes without any cyclic links or connections between them except through the central node. There are three instances of this pattern in the graph image.

**Conclusion:**

* The pattern identified in the graph is "star".
* The number of patterns is 3.
* The analysis reveals that the graph's structure, with its central nodes and radiating connections, defines it as a star pattern.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
  "pattern": ["star"],
  "number_of_patterns": 3,
  "analysis": "The graph exhibits a star pattern, characterized by central nodes with radiating connections to other nodes, aligning with the definition of a star pattern. This structure is observed in three separate instances within the graph."
