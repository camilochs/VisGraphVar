  "analysis": "The graph consists of three separate components. Each component forms a chain-like structure where nodes are connected sequentially. Component 1: 0-1-2-3. Component 2: 4-5-6-7. Component 3: 8-9-10-11. Therefore, the pattern present in the graph is 'chain,' and there are three instances of this pattern."
