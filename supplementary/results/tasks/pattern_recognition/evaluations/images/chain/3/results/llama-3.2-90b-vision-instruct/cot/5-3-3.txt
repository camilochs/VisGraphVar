To identify the pattern type in the given graph, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Observe Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters/Groups/Links**: The graph consists of three distinct parts. There is a cluster to the left with nodes 0, 1, and 2. In the middle-to-right side, there's a cluster involving nodes 6, 7, and 8. Lastly, towards the bottom right, another cluster includes nodes 3, 4, and 5.

2. **Determine Interconnection Type**: Within each cluster, the nodes are connected to each other but not to any outside their cluster. For instance, node 0 is connected to node 1, which is further connected to node 2, forming a sequence. This can be categorized as a chain-like connection because each connection forms a sequence without any branching at a single point.

3. **Count Instances of Each Identified Pattern**: Since we've identified that each cluster represents a chain, and there are three distinct clusters, there are three instances of the 'chain' pattern.

4. **Explain Reasoning**: The reasoning behind identifying these as 'chain' patterns lies in the sequential nature of their connections. Each cluster has nodes that are sequentially connected, with no node being a central point to multiple others in a star configuration, nor are all nodes in a cluster interconnected as would be seen in a clique.

Given this analysis, the appropriate JSON response is:

```
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph visually presents three clusters where nodes within each cluster are sequentially connected, indicating a chain-like pattern. This matches the criteria for a chain, where nodes are connected in a sequence without a central node or complete interconnection among all nodes.'
}
```
