   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct chains. Each chain is a sequence of nodes where each node is connected to at most two other nodes, forming a linear structure. There are no fully interconnected nodes or a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes, which rules out 'clique' and 'star' patterns. Therefore, the identified pattern type is 'chain'."
