**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the graph, we will follow the steps outlined:

1. **Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**:
   - The graph consists of three distinct groups of nodes.
   - Each group appears to be isolated from the others.

2. **Determine if Nodes are Interconnected in a Continuous Sequence, Fully Interconnected Without Isolated Nodes, or if There is a Central Node with Surrounding Peripheral Nodes**:
   - Upon closer inspection, each group represents a sequence where nodes are connected in a continuous chain rather than being fully interconnected without isolated nodes or having a central node with peripheral nodes.
   - There are no indications of interconnectedness between different groups.

3. **Count How Many Instances of Each Identified Pattern Appear in the Graph**:
   - All three groups depict a chain-like structure where nodes are sequentially connected.
   - There are no instances of cliques (where all nodes are interconnected) or stars (with a central node and peripheral nodes).

**Conclusion**:

Given the analysis, the identified pattern type is a 'chain'. There are three instances of this pattern type in the image.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```json
{
  'pattern': ['chain'],
  'number_of_patterns': 3,
  'analysis': 'The graph shows three distinct groups, each following a chain-like pattern with nodes sequentially connected. There are no signs of cliques or stars within the graph. Thus, the identified pattern type is a chain, with three such patterns present.'
}
