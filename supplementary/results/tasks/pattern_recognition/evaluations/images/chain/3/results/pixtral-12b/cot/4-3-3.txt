In each cluster, the nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence, with each node linking to the next in a linear fashion.\n3. The first cluster comprises nodes 5, 4, and 3; the second cluster comprises nodes 0, 1, and 2; the third cluster comprises nodes 6, 7, and 8.\n4. No node is fully interconnected with others in each cluster, nor are there any central nodes with peripheral nodes, so the patterns observed are chains."
