The graph image is not provided about a star pattern, assuming there is 1 vertex with a fixed amount of edges and then every other vertex (after the first node) does not have any edges. The definition of a star-shaped graph pattern is 1 node connected to every other node in the graph via direct edges or via direct edges and then chain-pattern edges.
