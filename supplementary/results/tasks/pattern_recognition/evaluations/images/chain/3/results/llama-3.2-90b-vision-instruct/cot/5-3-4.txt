The graph displays four separate chains, each consisting of linked clusters of nodes without any isolated elements within those chains.

**Step 2: Pattern Type Determination**

*   **Chain:** A chain is a linear sequence of connected nodes
*   **Clique:** A clique is a complete subgraph where every node is connected to every other node
*   **Star:** A star is a subgraph with a central node connected to all peripheral nodes but with peripheral nodes not connected to each other

**Step 3: Counting Pattern Types**

This graph features multiple chain patterns, indicating separate linked sequences of knots.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": 4,
   "analysis": "This graph features 4 separate chains, each containing a series of interconnected nodes without isolated elements within those chains. These chains illustrate the chain pattern as they are discrete sequences of interconnected nodes."
}
```

The graph showcases four distinct chain patterns, as evidenced by the separate, linked groups of nodes without isolated elements. By the nature of connectedness, they exemplify the chain pattern, representing separate series of interconnected nodes.
