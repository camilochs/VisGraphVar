**Graph Pattern Analysis**

To identify the type of pattern in the given graph, we analyze the structure and connections between nodes.

### Pattern Types

The following pattern types are possible:

*   **Chain**: A chain consists of nodes connected in a linear sequence where each node (except the first and last) is connected to exactly two other nodes.
*   **Clique**: A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent; that is, every pair of distinct vertices in the clique connects to every other vertex in the clique.
*   **Star**: A star graph is characterized by one central node connected to every other node, while these outer nodes have no connections among themselves - only to the central node.

### Analyzing the Graph

Upon inspection, the graph shows multiple linear sequences with each node within a sequence directly connected to the next and previous one, without any indication of a node connecting to every other node, which would be characteristic of a star or clique patterns. Specifically:

*   There are no nodes where every other node is directly connected to it, ruling out the star pattern.
*   There is no subgraph where every node is connected to every other node, eliminating the clique pattern as a possibility.

**Conclusion**

Given these observations, the pattern that most accurately describes the connections in the graph is a chain pattern because it consists of one continuous path connecting all nodes in a linear fashion, with no indication of additional patterns like stars or cliques. Therefore, the graph contains one chain pattern, making the number of patterns detected equal to one.
