**Graph Pattern Analysis**

To analyze the graph pattern, we examine the structure and connections between nodes.

* **Nodes and Connections**
	+ Three distinct sets of nodes are disconnected from each other.
	+ Each set consists of linearly connected nodes.
* **Conclusion**

Based on the features observed, the graph contains **chain** patterns. Specifically, three separate chains are identified.
