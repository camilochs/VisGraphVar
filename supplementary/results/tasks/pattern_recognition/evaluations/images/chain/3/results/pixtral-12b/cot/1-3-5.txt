### Analysis of the Graph

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**
   - The graph consists of three separate clusters of nodes, with no connections between the clusters.

2. **Determine the pattern type of each distinct cluster:**
   - **Cluster 1 (top right):**
     - It has nodes labeled 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
     - Nodes 7, 8, and 9 form a continuous chain, while nodes 5 and 6 are branching off.
     - Pattern: **Chain** with branching.

   - **Cluster 2 (bottom right):**
     - It has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
     - These nodes are connected in a continuous sequence.
     - Pattern: **Chain**.

   - **Cluster 3 (left):**
     - It has nodes labeled 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
     - These nodes are connected in a continuous sequence.
     - Pattern: **Chain**.

3. **Count the instances of each identified pattern:**
   - There are three instances of the **Chain** pattern (one is a chain with a branch).

4. **Explanation of the reasoning:**
   - Each cluster consists of a sequence of connected nodes, which qualifies them as chains.
   - In the first cluster, the presence of branches from the main chain makes it distinct but still falls under the chain category with anomalies.
