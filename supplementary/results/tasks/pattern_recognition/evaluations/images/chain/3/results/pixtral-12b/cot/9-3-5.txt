   Step 1: Observing the structure of the graph, we see that nodes are connected in linear sequences without branching within each cluster.
   Step 2: Each cluster of nodes follows a sequential connection pattern, forming chains rather than branching out to other nodes within the group. This does not resemble a 'clique' as there are no fully interconnected nodes, nor does it resemble a 'star' as nodes are not radiating from a central hub.
   Step 3: Counting the number of chain patterns, there are four distinct clusters observed: 
     - The first chain is from node 14 to node 12.
     - The second chain is from node 5 to node 9.
     - The third chain is from node 9 to node 8.
     - The fourth chain is from node 4 to node 0.
