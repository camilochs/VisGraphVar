Observing each cluster individually, nodes are interconnected in a straightforward sequence where each node is linked to exactly two other nodes (except the first and last nodes in the sequence).\n3. This indicates that each cluster follows a linear 'chain' pattern.\n4. Counting the clusters, we identify three chains within the graph.\nTherefore, the pattern type identified is 'chain'."
