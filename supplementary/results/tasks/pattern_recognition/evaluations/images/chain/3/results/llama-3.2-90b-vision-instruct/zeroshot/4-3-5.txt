Given that no image was provided, a detailed analysis cannot be conducted. However, with the help of a computer system, generally a pattern in a graph can be identified based on its structure.
    - 
    "chain" pattern is formed by a series of nodes connected in a linear sequence.
    - 
    A "clique" pattern exists when all nodes in a sub-graph are connected to each other.
    - 
    A "star" pattern is defined by a central node and one or more surrounding nodes that are connected only to the central node. Without more information and a visual aid, the exact nature of your query cannot be determined.  Here is the response for an example image of a "chain" with features described based on this hypothetical situation:


    ```json
    {
        "pattern": "chain",
        "number_of_patterns": 1,
        "analysis": "Nodes in the graph are connected in a linear sequence, forming a chain pattern."
    }
    ```


This hypothetical example shows one possible scenario where a pattern such as this one might be identified. Since no image was rendered actual information cannot be given.
