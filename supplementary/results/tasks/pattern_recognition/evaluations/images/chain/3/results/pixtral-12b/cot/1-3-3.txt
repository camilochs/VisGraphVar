Based on the given graph image, the pattern can be analyzed and identified as follows:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**
   - The graph consists of three distinct clusters of nodes.
   
2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence, fully interconnected without isolated nodes, or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes:**
   - The first cluster forms a chain with nodes 5 -> 4 -> 3.
   - The second cluster forms a chain with nodes 7 -> 8.
   - The third cluster forms a chain with nodes 1 -> 2.
   
3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:**
   - There are 3 instances of the chain pattern.
   
4. **Explain the reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes:**
   - Nodes in the first cluster (5 -> 4 -> 3) are connected in a continuous sequence forming a chain.
   - Nodes in the second cluster (7 -> 8) are also connected in a continuous sequence forming a chain.
   - Nodes in the third cluster (1 -> 2) again form a continuous sequence forming a chain.
   
   Therefore, all the clusters resemble a chain pattern.
