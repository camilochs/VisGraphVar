**Type of Pattern in the Graph**

To determine the type of pattern in the graph, we need to analyze its structure. The graph consists of three separate clusters of nodes, each connected in a linear fashion.

**Analysis**

*   The first cluster contains nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11.
*   The second cluster contains nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
*   The third cluster contains nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Each cluster represents a chain-like structure where each node is connected only to its immediate neighbors.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph contains three instances of a chain pattern. Therefore, the correct answer is:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "The graph contains three separate clusters of nodes, each connected in a linear fashion, forming chain-like structures."
}
