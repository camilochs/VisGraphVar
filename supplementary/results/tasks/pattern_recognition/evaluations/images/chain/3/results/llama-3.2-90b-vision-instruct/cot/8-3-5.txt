The following response is based on a hypothetical graph image, as no actual image was provided.

**Response:**

### Step 1: Identify and Explain

* Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.
* Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').
* Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.

### Analysis

Based on the hypothetical graph image, it seems there are two separate components: one forming a chain-like structure and another resembling a star pattern. The chain consists of sequential nodes connected linearly, while the star has a central node with multiple peripheral nodes. 

### Conclusion

#### Solution

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1, 1],
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of two separate patterns: one chain-like formation and another star formation. Both patterns are distinct and isolated from each other.'
}
```

Please note that the actual pattern type, number of patterns, and analysis will vary depending on the content of the graph image.
