**Step 1: Identify the components in the image.**

Each component in the image is a node that is connected to other nodes. Some nodes are only connected to one other node, while other nodes are connected to two or three nodes.

**Step 2: Are there any chains?**

A chain is a type of pattern that includes a line of nodes where each node is connected to another node. 

This pattern can be found in the figure where nodes 9 and 10, nodes 7 and 5, and nodes 0 and 1 form chains.

**Step 3: Is there a clique?**

A clique is a type of pattern where the nodes in a pattern connect to all other nodes. 

There are no cliques in the figure because there does not exist a set of nodes that connect to all other nodes in that set.

**Step 4: Is there a star?**

A star is another type of pattern where a central node has connections to every other node.  

The figure shows that Node 6 only connects to two other nodes, Node 7 and Node 5, and therefore Node 6 also does not contain a star pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the diagram, we can say the image includes a chain pattern that appears three times. 

There do not exist any other combinations of connections between the nodes in the diagram that form a clique or star, so those patterns do not exist in this example.
