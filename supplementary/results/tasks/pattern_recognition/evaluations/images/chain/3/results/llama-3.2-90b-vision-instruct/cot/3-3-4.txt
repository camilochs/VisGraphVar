To provide a reliable and accurate analysis, I have examined the graph image and identified the following patterns:

### Step 1: Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links

The graph image reveals a distinct cluster of interconnected nodes, forming a continuous sequence. This pattern is evident in the center of the image, where nodes 5, 6, and 7 are linked in a chain-like structure.

### Step 2: Determine the Type of Pattern

Based on the observation, the pattern in question is a chain, characterized by a continuous sequence of interconnected nodes without isolated nodes or a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes.

### Step 3: Count the Number of Instances of Each Identified Pattern

Upon careful examination, I have identified only one instance of the chain pattern in the graph image.

### Step 4: Explain the Reasoning

The reasoning behind this analysis is based on the layout and relationships among the nodes. The chain pattern, characterized by a continuous sequence of interconnected nodes (5, 6, and 7), meets the criteria established in Step 2. This pattern does not exhibit the characteristics of a clique or a star, as there are no isolated nodes or a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes.

**Answer:**
