**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the graph image, we will follow the steps outlined:

1. Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.
2. Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').
3. Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.

**Step 1: Identifying Clusters and Links**

Upon examining the graph, we notice three distinct clusters of nodes, each connected by lines representing links between them. These clusters are not fully interconnected with each other, indicating the absence of a clique structure for the entire graph.

**Step 2: Determining Pattern Types**

*   The first cluster, consisting of nodes 0 through 4, forms a continuous sequence where each node is connected to the next one in line. This indicates a 'chain' pattern.
*   The second cluster, comprising nodes 5 through 9, also displays a continuous sequence similar to the first cluster. Again, this signifies another instance of a 'chain' pattern.
*   The third cluster, containing nodes 10 through 14, demonstrates the same pattern as the first two clusters, forming a continuous sequence without any isolated nodes or fully interconnected nodes across different clusters, thus representing another 'chain' pattern.

**Step 3: Counting Instances of Each Pattern**

Based on our analysis, there are three distinct instances of the 'chain' pattern in the graph.

**Conclusion**

Given the continuous sequences observed in each cluster without the presence of a central node or full interconnection across all nodes, we conclude that the graph exhibits the 'chain' pattern. Furthermore, there are three such patterns present in the graph.
