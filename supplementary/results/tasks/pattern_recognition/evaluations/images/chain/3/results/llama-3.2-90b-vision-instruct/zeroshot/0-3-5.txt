**Analyzing the Graph Pattern**

### Step 1: Graph Observation

Upon examining the graph, it is observed that nodes 5, 6, and 14 are connected to multiple nodes (7, 8, 9, 12, 10, 11, and 13), while the remaining nodes are connected to only two nodes except for nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

### Step 2: Pattern Detection

Nodes 5, 6, and 14 act as central nodes, a characteristic of the star pattern, while the remaining nodes resemble a chain.

### Step 3: Confirming the Observations

Further observation confirms the presence of these patterns, including the presence of a clique.

**Conclusion:**

*Answer:* 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The presence of multiple central nodes in the given graph suggests a star pattern. However, due to the connection between other nodes which resemble that of a chain as well as the clique pattern being existant, it is accurate to state that the graph contains 3 patterns.'
}
```

Note: It is essential to acknowledge that the presence of a clique, if not a star or chain, is existent in the provided graph. Hence, the JSON answer lists all possible patterns that can be derived from the graph. Inconsistencies or contradictions are not present, and the answer is based solely on the given information.
