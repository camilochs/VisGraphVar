   "analysis": "The graph is composed of three distinct isolated groups of nodes. Each group forms a chain pattern where nodes are linked in a continuous sequence. The first group is a chain of three nodes (6, 7, 8), the second group is a chain of three nodes (0, 1, 2), and the third group is a chain of three nodes (3, 4, 5). Therefore, the pattern type identified is 'chain', and there are three instances of this pattern type in the image."
