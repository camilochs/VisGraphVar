**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we will analyze its structure and relationships among nodes.

### Step 1: Identifying Distinct Clusters

* The graph consists of three distinct clusters:
	+ Cluster 1: Nodes 0, 1, and 2
	+ Cluster 2: Nodes 6, 7, and 8
	+ Cluster 3: Nodes 3, 4, and 5

Each cluster has a similar structure where two nodes are directly connected to each other and another node is connected to only one of these.

### Step 2: Determining the Pattern Type

* Based on the structure of each cluster, it appears that all nodes within a cluster are interconnected but without forming a continuous sequence or a fully interconnected network.
* There is not a central node with peripheral nodes in any of the clusters.

### Step 3: Counting Instances of Each Pattern

* Since all clusters exhibit the same structural characteristics, they represent the same pattern type.
* There are **three** instances of this pattern in the graph.

**Conclusion**

* Based on the analysis, the pattern type in the graph can be described as a **clique**, given that all nodes within each cluster are interconnected but without isolations.
* The reasoning is based on the observation that:
	+ Each cluster forms a fully interconnected group (e.g., nodes 0, 1, and 2 are all connected).
	+ There is no evidence of a central node or a continuous sequence of nodes.
