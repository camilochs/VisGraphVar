   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct chain patterns. Each chain is characterized by nodes connected in a linear sequence where each node (except the endpoints) connects to exactly two other nodes. The first chain consists of nodes 5-6-7-8-9, the second chain contains nodes 10-11-12-13-14, and the third chain includes nodes 0-1-2-3-4. None of the nodes have more than two connections, confirming these are pure chain patterns."
