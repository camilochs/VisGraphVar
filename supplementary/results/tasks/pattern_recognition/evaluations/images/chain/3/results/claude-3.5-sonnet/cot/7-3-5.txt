   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct chain patterns. Pattern 1: nodes 0-1-2-3-4 form a linear sequence where each node connects only to its adjacent nodes. Pattern 2: nodes 5-6-7-8-9 form another linear chain sequence. Pattern 3: nodes 10-11-12-13-14 form a third chain-like sequence. Each chain demonstrates sequential connectivity where nodes are connected one after another without forming complete interconnections (cliques) or having a central hub node (star). The linear arrangement and the fact that most nodes have exactly two connections (except endpoints) clearly indicates these are chain patterns."
