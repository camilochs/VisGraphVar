**Analysis of the Graph Image**

After carefully examining the graph image, I have identified the pattern type and counted its instances.

**Pattern Type:** The identified pattern is a "star." In a star pattern, there is a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. This structure is characterized by the presence of a hub node with direct links to surrounding nodes.

**Number of Patterns:** Upon closer inspection, I observed that there are three distinct clusters in the graph image, each exhibiting the characteristics of a star pattern. 

**Analysis:** In the graph image, I observed three groups of nodes. The first group consists of nodes 6, 7, and 8, with node 7 serving as the central node. The second group comprises nodes 0, 1, and 2, with node 0 at the center. The third group includes nodes 3, 4, and 5, with node 4 as the central node. 

Each of these groups displays the defining features of a star pattern: a central node connected to surrounding peripheral nodes. By considering the structural organization of the nodes and the nature of their interconnections, it becomes evident that the graph image predominantly consists of star patterns.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the identified pattern is a "star" and it appears three times in the graph image.
