**Analysis**

To identify the pattern in the graph, we need to examine its structure. The graph consists of disconnected components with edges connecting nodes within each component. 

We can see the following components:

*   Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 form a chain.
*   Nodes 14, 13, 12, 11, and 10 also form a chain.
*   Nodes 4, 3, 2, and 1 form a chain as well.

These observations lead us to conclude that the graph contains the "chain" pattern. Since there are three distinct chains identified, the number of patterns is 3.

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct chain patterns: one consisting of nodes 5 through 9, another of nodes 14 through 10, and a third of nodes 4 through 1."
}
