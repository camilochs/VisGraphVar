**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the given graph, we need to analyze its structure and connectivity.

**Pattern**
```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains two separate chains, each with its nodes connected linearly.' 
}
```

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph exhibits a "chain" pattern, with two separate sequences of nodes connected linearly.
