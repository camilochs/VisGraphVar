   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct chain patterns. Each chain is characterized by nodes connected in a linear sequence where each node (except the endpoints) connects to exactly two other nodes. The three chains are: (11-10-9-8), (0-1-2-3), and (4-5-6-7). None of the nodes have more than two connections, which rules out star or clique patterns."
