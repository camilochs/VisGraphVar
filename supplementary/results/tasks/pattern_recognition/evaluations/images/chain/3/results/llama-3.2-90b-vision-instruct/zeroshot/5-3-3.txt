**Pattern Identification**

To identify the type of pattern in the given graph image, let's analyze its structure:

*   The graph consists of vertices (nodes) and edges that connect these vertices.
*   Each node is labeled with a unique number.
*   Edges are drawn between some pairs of nodes without any indication of direction.

### Chain Pattern

A chain pattern is characterized by nodes connected linearly, where each node is connected directly to the next one in a sequence, with no branching or cycles. In the provided image, there is no clear linear sequence of nodes connecting one after the other without branching, which suggests this is not a chain pattern.

### Clique Pattern

A clique pattern consists of a subset of nodes where every pair of distinct nodes is connected by an edge, meaning all nodes in the clique are directly connected to each other. In the given image, there isn't a subset of nodes where each node is directly connected to every other node within that subset. Thus, this does not represent a clique pattern.

### Star Pattern

A star pattern features a central node that connects directly to multiple other nodes, while these peripheral nodes do not connect directly to each other. Looking at the image, we can observe that node "7" acts as a central node, connecting directly to nodes "6" and "8." Notably, nodes "6" and "8" do not have a direct connection. This arrangement fits the description of a star pattern.

**Conclusion**

Given the observations above, the graph image illustrates a star pattern. Specifically, there is one clear instance where a central node connects to multiple peripheral nodes that do not mutually connect.
