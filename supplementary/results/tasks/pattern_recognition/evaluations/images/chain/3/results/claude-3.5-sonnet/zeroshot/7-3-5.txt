   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct chain patterns: one chain from nodes 0-4 (5 nodes), another chain from nodes 5-9 (5 nodes), and a smaller chain from nodes 10-14 (5 nodes). In each chain, the nodes are connected sequentially with each node (except endpoints) connected to exactly two other nodes, which is characteristic of a chain pattern."
