**ASTAR Pattern Recognition**

The graph in the image exhibits a 'chain' pattern, with distinct characteristics. Specifically:

*   The graph consists of three separate chains:
    *   A chain from node 11 to node 8, with 5 nodes (11, 10, 9, 8).
    *   A chain from node 7 to node 4, with 4 nodes (7, 6, 5, 4).
    *   A chain from node 3 to node 0, with 4 nodes (3, 2, 1, 0).

This indicates that the graph pattern is a 'chain.' Therefore, the results can be expressed as follows:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph is composed of three separate chains, indicating that it follows a chain pattern.\}'' 
} 
```

*Answer*: The graph follows a chain pattern.
