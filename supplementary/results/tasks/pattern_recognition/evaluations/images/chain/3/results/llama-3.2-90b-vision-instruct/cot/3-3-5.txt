**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we will follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links

Upon examining the graph, we notice that there are two separate collections of connected nodes. Each collection forms a continuous sequence where each node is connected to its immediate neighbors.

### Step 2: Determine the Pattern Type

Based on the observation that each collection forms a continuous sequence without any isolated nodes or a central node controlling connections to other nodes, we identify these sequences as 'chains.' A 'chain' pattern is characterized by a series of nodes where each node directly connects only to the next one in the sequence.

### Step 3: Count the Number of Patterns

There are two distinct sequences, so there are two 'chain' patterns in the graph.

### Step 4: Summarize the Analysis

In conclusion, the identified pattern type is a 'chain,' and there are two instances of this pattern in the provided graph.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain"],
   "number_of_patterns": [2],
   "analysis": "The graph consists of two distinct sequences where each node connects directly to its immediate neighbors, forming a chain. This layout matches the criteria for a chain pattern, with no isolated nodes or central controlling nodes indicative of star or clique patterns, respectively."
