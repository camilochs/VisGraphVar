**Analysis of the Graph Image**

To determine the pattern type in the graph image, we will analyze its structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.

**Step 1: Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**

The graph image consists of multiple nodes connected by lines. Upon closer inspection, we can see that each node is connected to only one other node, forming a chain-like structure.

**Step 2: Determine the Type of Pattern**

Based on the structure, we can conclude that the graph represents a **chain** pattern. A chain pattern is characterized by nodes being interconnected in a continuous sequence, where each node is connected to only one other node.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Instances of Each Identified Pattern**

There are **3** instances of the chain pattern in the graph image.

**Step 4: Explain the Reasoning Based on the Layout and Relationships Among Nodes**

The graph image exhibits a chain-like structure, where each node is connected to only one other node. This is evident from the way the nodes are arranged in a linear sequence, with each node having only one incoming and one outgoing edge. The lack of isolated nodes or fully interconnected nodes further supports the conclusion that the graph represents a chain pattern.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the graph image represents a **chain** pattern, with **3** instances of this pattern present in the image. The analysis of the graph's structure and the relationships among nodes confirm this conclusion.
