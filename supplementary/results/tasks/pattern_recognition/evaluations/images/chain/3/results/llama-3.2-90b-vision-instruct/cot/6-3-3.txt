The graph image contains three distinct clusters: one with nodes 3, 4, and 5; another with nodes 7, 8, and 6; and a third with nodes 0, 1, and 2.

**Cluster Analysis**

Each cluster forms its own 'chain' pattern, as nodes are connected in a continuous sequence. For instance, cluster 3-4-5 shows a chain where node 3 is linked to node 4, and node 4 is linked to node 5.

**Clique and Star Patterns**

There are no instances of a 'clique' or 'star' pattern in the graph.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of three chains that maintain a continuous sequence order. A chain is a pattern orientation in a graph structure where each node has a unique predecessor and successor except for the ones at the ends.'
}
