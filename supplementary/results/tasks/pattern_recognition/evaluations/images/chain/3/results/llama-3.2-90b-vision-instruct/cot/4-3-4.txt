**Step 1: Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links**

Upon examining the graph, it appears to be a collection of interconnected nodes. There are no isolated clusters or groups; instead, all nodes seem to be connected in a single network.

**Step 2: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').**

The graph does not display a continuous sequence where each node is directly connected to the next in a linear fashion, which rules out a 'chain.' Additionally, it lacks a central node from which all other nodes branch out directly, eliminating the possibility of a 'star.'

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that every node is connected to every other node, either directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate nodes. This fits the description of a 'clique,' where all nodes are interlinked without any isolated components.

**Step 3: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph**

Given the analysis, the entire graph constitutes a single instance of a 'clique' since all nodes are interconnected and there are no isolated sets of nodes forming separate cliques.

**Conclusion:**

A single instance of a 'clique' is present in the graph, characterized by its interconnected nature devoid of isolated nodes or subsets. This conclusion is drawn from the connectivity patterns observed among the nodes within the graph.
