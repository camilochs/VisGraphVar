(graph image)

To analyze the given graph and identify the pattern in it, we observe that the image sequence makes lines from one end to the other with no groupings where all the individual instances are connected to each other 'apple >> banana >> apple'. Each element in the sequence forms a 'line' by connecting each instance to transfer a communication signal or to transfer data between elements. Therefore, the type of pattern contained in this image is a series of connecting relationships among elements in a desired structure.

Given this, the image follows the Chain pattern, a graph data structure pattern where nodes attached to the current one indicates the preceding one or vice versa and maintains sequence among its elements.

Since it is continuous from the start-connected pattern till the end with information flowing linearly rather than being directed back to its first element or in multiple directions around intermediate nodes, the analysis will output number_of_patterns equal to 1 element and:

{
   'pattern': ['chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1],
   'analysis': 'communication happens linearly.'
}
