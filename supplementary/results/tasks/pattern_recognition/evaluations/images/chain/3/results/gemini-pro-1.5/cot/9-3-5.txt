  "analysis": "The graph consists of two separate sets of nodes. In each set, the nodes are connected sequentially, forming a chain-like structure.  The first chain starts at node 14 and ends at node 10 (14-13-12-11-10). The chain also branches off at node 5 and continues to node 9 (5-6-7-8-9). The second chain starts at node 0 and ends at node 4 (0-1-2-3-4). Because the nodes form a sequence with each node (except endpoints) connecting to a maximum of two other nodes within their respective sequences, the pattern is identified as a 'chain'."
