**Analysis of the Graph Image**

Based on the provided description and typical features of graph patterns, I conducted an analysis to determine the type of pattern present in the graph image.

**Conclusion**

*   **Pattern Type:** The graph image contains a **chain** pattern.
*   **Number of Patterns:** There are **2** instances of the chain pattern.
*   **Rationale:** A chain pattern is characterized by a sequence of connected nodes or vertices with each node connected to its immediate predecessor and successor. In the given graph image, I identified two distinct sequences where nodes are connected in a linear fashion without any branching or loops, indicating the presence of chain patterns.

**Answer**

```json
{
  "pattern": "chain",
  "number_of_patterns": 2,
  "analysis": "The graph image contains two sequences of connected nodes where each node is connected to its immediate predecessor and successor, indicating the presence of chain patterns."
}
```

This analysis is based on the description of the graph image and the typical features associated with chain patterns in graph theory.
