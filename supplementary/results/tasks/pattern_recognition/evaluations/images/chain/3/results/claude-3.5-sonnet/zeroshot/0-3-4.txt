    "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct chain patterns. Each chain is characterized by nodes connected in a linear sequence without any branching. The first chain consists of nodes 7-6-5-4, the second chain includes nodes 3-2-1-0, and the third chain contains nodes 11-10-9-8. In each chain, every node (except endpoints) is connected to exactly two other nodes."
