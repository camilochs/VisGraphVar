   "analysis": "The graph shows three distinct chain patterns: First chain from nodes 0-4 (5 nodes), second chain from nodes 5-9 (5 nodes), and third chain from nodes 10-14 (5 nodes). Each chain exhibits a sequential connection where nodes are linked one after another in a linear fashion. There are no central hub nodes (which would indicate a star pattern) and no fully interconnected groups (which would indicate a clique pattern). Each node (except endpoints) connects to exactly two other nodes, which is characteristic of chain patterns."
