Here's the analysis of the given graph image in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3, 1, 1],
   'analysis': "The graph contains three distinct patterns: 
   - Three 'chain' patterns (linear sequences of nodes) where each chain has adjacent nodes connected in a straight line.
   - One 'clique' pattern (cluster of fully connected nodes) seen in a subset of nodes that are all connected to each other (nodes 10, 11, 12, and 13).
   - One 'star' pattern (a central node connected to all peripheral nodes) observed with node 11 at the center connecting to surrounding nodes."
}
```

This JSON format transmits the types andcount of the detected patterns along with an explanation of their features.
