Node 10 is connected to node 11, which in turn is connected to node 12. This continues downwards with node 12 connected to node 13 and node 13 connected to node 14, forming a continuous straight line or a "chain."\n2. The second cluster (bottom and top right) resembles a structure with a central node and peripheral nodes. Specifically, node 0 is connected to node 1, which serves as the branch point leading to nodes 2, 3, and 4, similar to a star formation with a central node.\nThus, there are two distinct patterns identified in the graph: one "chain" pattern and one "star" pattern.'
