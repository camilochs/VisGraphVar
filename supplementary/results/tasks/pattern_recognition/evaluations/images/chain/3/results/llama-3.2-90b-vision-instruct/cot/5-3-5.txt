In the given image, we can see three distinct groups of interconnected nodes, each forming a continuous sequence. There are no isolated nodes, nor is there a single central node with peripheral nodes.

This suggests that the pattern type present in the image is a 'chain,' as all nodes within each group are connected sequentially without any isolated or centralized patterns.

The image contains three instances of this chain pattern.

The identified pattern type is 'chain,' with three occurrences.

```json
{
  'pattern': 'chain',
  'number_of_patterns': 3,
  'analysis': 'Three sequences of nodes, each forming a linear connection without isolation or centralization.'
}
