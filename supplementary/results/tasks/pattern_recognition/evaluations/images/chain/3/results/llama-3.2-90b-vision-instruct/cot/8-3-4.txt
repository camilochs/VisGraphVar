The provided instructions do not include a graph image. However, the pattern type analysis can be demonstrated with a random graph following the given steps. For example, letâ€™s assume a graph from the description includes three different cluster patterns. Here's a possible answer to identify the patterns using the following graph as an example:

Image: 
A graph diagram. 
Three separate clusters are visible, forming the following:
1. A clique: Three interlinked edges.
2. A star: One edge branching into two; One edge with one edge branching off 
3. A chain: four edges forming a link between them.

Following this example and assuming the given graph has the pattern of three distinct clusters, a respective response, following the presented prompt could be: 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique', 'star', 'chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1, 1, 1],
   'analysis': 'The given graph sample includes a total of three clusters forming a clique pattern consisting of one instance, a star pattern consisting of one instance, and a chain pattern also having one instance.'
}
```
