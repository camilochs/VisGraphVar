I'm not able to analyze an image. However, I can provide a general response based on the possible patterns you've mentioned: 'chain,' 'clique,' or 'star.' 

```json
{
   'pattern': 'N/A',
   'number_of_patterns': 'N/A',
   'analysis': 'This response is a placeholder and any analysis would depend on the image of the graph you intended to provide.'
}
```

If you provide a description of the graph, I can complete the analysis.
