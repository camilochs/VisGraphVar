   "analysis": "There are three distinct clusters in the graph, each with a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. The first cluster has node 5 as the central node with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as its periphery. The second cluster has node 0 as the central node connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. The third cluster has node 10 as the central node with nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. Each cluster follows a 'star' pattern as there is one central node to which all other nodes in the cluster are connected, without any peripheral nodes being interconnected."
