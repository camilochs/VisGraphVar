**Pattern Analysis**

To identify the pattern in the given graph, we will analyze its structure and connectivity.

**Available Data:**

* The graph consists of 14 nodes (0-13) with various connections between them.
* Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are directly connected to node 0.
* Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are directly connected to node 0.
* Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are directly connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.

**Analysis:**

The graph exhibits a centralized structure where multiple nodes are directly connected to a central node (node 0). This characteristic is typical of a **star pattern**, where one central node is connected to all other nodes.

**Conclusion:**

```json
{
   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": 1,
   "analysis": "The graph contains a central node (0) connected to multiple nodes, forming a star pattern."
}
```

The graph displays a single star pattern centered around node 0, with multiple nodes connected to it.
