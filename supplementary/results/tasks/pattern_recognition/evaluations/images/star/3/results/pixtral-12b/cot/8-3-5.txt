          \
        2. The Levin number 5 is the central node to surrounding nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. This shows a star pattern.\
         \
        3. The Levin number 0 is the central node to surrounding nodes 2, 1, 3, and 4.\
         \
        4. The Levin number 10 is the central node to surrounding nodes 13, 14, 11, and 12.\
     \
       5. Based on the connectivity and layout, all clusters follow a central node with peripheral nodes structure, which confirms a star pattern.\
