Analyzing the Image Structure

Upon examining the provided image, we can observe distinct clusters of nodes grouped together in different patterns.

Identifying Pattern Types

Each cluster comprises a central node surrounded by 2â€“4 peripheral nodes, indicating connectivity solely between the central node and its immediate neighbors. This configuration is characteristic of a star pattern.

Pattern Count

We identify a total of 3 clusters aligning with the star pattern, with central nodes 0, 5, and 10. Each central node connects to peripheral nodes, confirming the presence of 3 star patterns.

Conclusion

Based on the image structure and cluster analysis, we conclude that the identified pattern type is a star.

### Final Answer

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'Upon examining the image, we identified three distinct clusters of nodes, each featuring a central node linked to peripheral nodes. This structure aligns with the defining characteristics of a star pattern, where connectivity is primarily between the central node and its immediate neighbors. Following the criteria for pattern identification, we successfully discerned a total of 3 star patterns in the image.'
