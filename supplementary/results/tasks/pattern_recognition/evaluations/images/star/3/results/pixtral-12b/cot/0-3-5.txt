   "analysis": "First, the graph was observed to identify how nodes are connected. There are three distinct clusters in the image, each consisting of central nodes connected to multiple peripheral nodes. This observation suggests that the nodes within each cluster are interconnected with a central node and multiple surrounding nodes. This is characteristic of a 'star' pattern. Specifically, in each cluster: 1) Cluster on the top right with central node 10 connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14; 2) Cluster on the bottom right with central node 5 connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9; 3) Cluster on the bottom left with central node 0 connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the three identified patterns are all of the 'star' type."
