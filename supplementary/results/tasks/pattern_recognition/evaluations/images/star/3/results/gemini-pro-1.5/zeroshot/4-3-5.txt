  "analysis": "Three separate, disconnected star patterns are present. The first star is centered around node 0 and connects to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. The second star is centered around node 5 and connects to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. The third star is centered around node 10 and connects to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14.  Each 'star' structure has a central node connected to multiple leaf nodes that aren't directly connected."
