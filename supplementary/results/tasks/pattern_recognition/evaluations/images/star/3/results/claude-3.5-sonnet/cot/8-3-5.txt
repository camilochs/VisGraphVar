   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star pattern has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes: (1) Node 0 is the center connecting to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4; (2) Node 5 is the center connecting to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9; (3) Node 10 is the center connecting to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. In each case, the peripheral nodes are only connected to their respective central node and not to each other, which is characteristic of a star pattern. The graph shows three separate components, each displaying this same star topology."
