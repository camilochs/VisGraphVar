   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star has one central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. The first star pattern centers around node 0 with peripheral nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. The second star pattern centers around node 5 with peripheral nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. The third star pattern centers around node 10 with peripheral nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. None of these peripheral nodes connect to each other, confirming the 'star' pattern."
