   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. 1) One star centered at node 0 with four connections to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. 2) Another star centered at node 5 with four connections to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. 3) A third star centered at node 10 with four connections to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. In each case, there is a central node with radiating connections to peripheral nodes, which is characteristic of the star pattern. The peripheral nodes in each star are only connected to their respective central node and not to each other."
