   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Observing the structure:\n\n1. Each central node is connected to three peripheral nodes, fulfilling the 'star' pattern.\n2. The first star is centered around node 5, connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.\n3. The second star is centered around node 0, connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n4. The third star is centered around node 10, connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14.\n\nThis verifies that each part of the graph follows the 'star' pattern structure."
