**Property to determine:** Pattern type in the graph.

**Relevant data:**

* Three distinct clusters of nodes.
* Each cluster has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes.
* No isolated nodes or continuous sequences of nodes.

**Analysis:**

Based on the observation that each cluster is centered around a node with direct connections to all surrounding nodes, and there are no isolated nodes or continuous sequences, this pattern resembles a 'star.' There are three instances of such clusters in the graph.

**Conclusion:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The graph exhibits three clusters, each structured as a star with a central node connected to all peripheral nodes, indicating a star pattern.'
}
