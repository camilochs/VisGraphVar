The graph image presents different interconnected nodes forming distinct clusters. Let's analyze the structure step-by-step:

1. **Observe the Structure**:
   - There are three clearly defined clusters of nodes in the graph image.
   - Each cluster contains nodes that are directly connected to each other but are separated from the other clusters.

2. **Identify the Pattern Type for Each Cluster**:
   - **Cluster 1** (Left-side):
     - Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 2, 4
     - The nodes form a loop where each node is connected to two other nodes, suggesting a **ring** or **cycle** pattern.

   - **Cluster 2** (Top-side):
     - Nodes: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
     - The nodes are fully interconnected without isolated nodes, suggesting a **clique**.

   - **Cluster 3** (Right-side):
     - Nodes: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
     - The nodes form a loop where each node is connected to two other nodes, suggesting a **ring** or **cycle** pattern.

3. **Count the Instances of Each Identified Pattern**:
   - There are **2** clusters forming a ring or cycle pattern.
   - There is **1** cluster forming a clique.

4. **Explanation**:
   - **Ring/Cycle Pattern**: Each node in these clusters is connected to exactly two other nodes, forming a circular sequence. This structure is typical of cycles in graph theory.
   - **Clique Pattern**: All nodes in this cluster are connected to every other node in the cluster, indicating that it's a fully connected subgraph.

The identified patterns help in understanding the overall structure and arrangement of nodes in the graph image.
