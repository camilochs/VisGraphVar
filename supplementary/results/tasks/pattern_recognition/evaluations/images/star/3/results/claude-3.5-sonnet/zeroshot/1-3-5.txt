    "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes in a spoke-like arrangement. Specifically, there is a star centered at node 0 with four connections, a star centered at node 5 with four connections, and a star centered at node 10 with four connections. In each case, the central node acts as a hub connecting to multiple outer nodes with no direct connections between the peripheral nodes, which is characteristic of a star pattern."
