   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to multiple outer nodes in a radial fashion. Specifically, node 5 connects to nodes 6,7,8,9; node 0 connects to nodes 1,2,3,4; and node 10 connects to nodes 11,12,13,14. In each case, the outer nodes are only connected to their respective central node, which is characteristic of a star pattern."
