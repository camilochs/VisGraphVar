  "number_of_patterns": [3],
  "analysis": "The graph contains three separate star patterns. The first star is centered around node 0 and connects to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. The second star is centered around node 5 and connects to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. The third star is centered on node 10 and connects to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. Each of these subgraphs forms a star pattern because there's a central node connected to multiple leaf nodes, and those leaf nodes are not connected."
