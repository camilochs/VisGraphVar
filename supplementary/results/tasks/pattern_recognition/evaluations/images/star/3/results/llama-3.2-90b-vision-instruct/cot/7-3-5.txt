**Analysis of the Graph Image**

Based on the provided graph image, I will analyze the pattern type by following the given steps.

**Step 1: Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**

Upon examining the graph, we notice three distinct groups of nodes. Each group consists of a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes.

**Step 2: Determine if Nodes are Interconnected in a Continuous Sequence (Chain), Fully Interconnected without Isolated Nodes (Clique), or if there is a Central Node with Surrounding Peripheral Nodes (Star)**

Each group exhibits a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes, indicating a star-like structure. There are no continuous sequences or fully interconnected nodes without isolated nodes.

**Step 3: Count How Many Instances of Each Identified Pattern Appear in the Graph**

We observe three instances of the star pattern in the graph.

**Step 4: Explain Your Reasoning Based on the Layout and Relationships Among Nodes**

The graph displays three distinct star patterns, each comprising a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. This configuration is characteristic of a star pattern, where a central node acts as a hub, and the surrounding nodes are its direct connections. The absence of continuous sequences or fully interconnected nodes without isolated nodes supports the identification of the star pattern.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the graph image exhibits a star pattern, with three instances of this pattern present. The central nodes in each group, surrounded by multiple peripheral nodes, are indicative of a star-like structure.
