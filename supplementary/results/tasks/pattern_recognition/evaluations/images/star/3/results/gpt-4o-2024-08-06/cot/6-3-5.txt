Cluster 1 has node 0 as the central node with peripheral nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Cluster 2 has node 10 as the central node with peripheral nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. Cluster 3 has node 5 as the central node with peripheral nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each cluster represents a 'star' pattern, with the central node linking to other nodes but no connections among the peripheral nodes themselves."
