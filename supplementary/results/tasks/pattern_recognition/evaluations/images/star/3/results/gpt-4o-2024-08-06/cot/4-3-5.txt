   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct clusters. Each cluster has a central node connected to several peripheral nodes. The first cluster has node 0 connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. The second cluster has node 5 connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. The third cluster has node 10 connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. These structures match the 'star' pattern, as each has one central node with surrounding peripheral nodes."
