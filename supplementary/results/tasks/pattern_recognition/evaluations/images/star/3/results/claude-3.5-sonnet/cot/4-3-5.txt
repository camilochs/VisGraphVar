   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star pattern has a central node with multiple nodes connected to it in a radial fashion. Specifically: 1) A star with node 0 as the center, connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4; 2) A star with node 5 as the center, connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9; 3) A star with node 10 as the center, connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. In each case, the peripheral nodes are only connected to their respective central node and not to each other, which is characteristic of a star pattern."
