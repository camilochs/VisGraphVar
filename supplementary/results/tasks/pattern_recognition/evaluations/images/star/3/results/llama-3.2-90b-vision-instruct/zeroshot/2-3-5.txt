**Image Description**

The image portrays a graph featuring three distinct patterns. The first pattern, situated on the left, consists of four nodes (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) connected in a chain-like structure without any direct connections between the center nodes. The second pattern, located on the right, is formed by three nodes (0, 1, and 2) connected in a triangular shape, with their edges interconnected. Alongside the triangular pattern is a connected pair of nodes (3 and 4). The third pattern, at the bottom, is formed by five nodes (10, 11, 12, 13, and 14), also demonstrating a chain-like structure with limited indirect connections.

   'pattern': ['chain', 'clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2, 1, 0],
   'analysis': 'The chain pattern is indicated by the presence of connected, indirectly linked nodes forming a chain or linear structure. The clique pattern is evidenced by the connected triangular shape of three nodes, signifying complete interconnectivity. Lastly, there is a lack of star pattern, as it would require multiple nodes radiating out like the points of a star.'
