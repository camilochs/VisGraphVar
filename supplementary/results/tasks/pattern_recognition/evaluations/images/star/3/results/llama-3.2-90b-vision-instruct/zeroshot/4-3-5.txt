I am not capable of visually perceiving images, including the one you mentioned. However, based on your ability to describe and assess data and graph information using keywords, I can give instructions on how to answer your question.

To analyze the given graph image and identify the type of pattern it contains, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze Node Connections**: Look at how the nodes in the graph are connected. Are they directly connected to each other, or are there intermediate nodes?
2. **Identify Patterns**: Based on the connections, identify the pattern. If all nodes are interconnected with each other, it might be a clique. If one node is connected to multiple nodes and those nodes are not interconnected, it could be a star pattern. If the nodes are connected in a sequence where each node is connected to two others (except the first and last nodes), it might resemble a chain.
3. **Count Specific Patterns**: After identifying the pattern type, count how many instances of that pattern exist in the graph. For example, if you identify a star pattern and there are three different nodes acting as the central node for their respective sets of other nodes, then there are three star patterns.
4. **Conclusion**: Based on your analysis, provide the name of the pattern type you detected, the total count of this pattern type found, and a brief explanation of the features in the graph that led you to your conclusion.

**JSON Response**:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The presence of central nodes connected to multiple nodes without interconnections between those satellite nodes suggests a star pattern. Three such central nodes were identified.'
}
```

Alternatively, if the graph is structured differently, the response would reflect the appropriate pattern type (could be 'chain' or 'clique' depending on the graph's structure) and the quantity or existence of that pattern within the graph.
