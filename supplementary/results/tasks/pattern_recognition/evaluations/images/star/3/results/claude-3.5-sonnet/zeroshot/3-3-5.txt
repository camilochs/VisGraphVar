    "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. The first star has node 0 as center with nodes 1,2,3,4 as peripherals. The second star has node 5 as center with nodes 6,7,8,9 as peripherals. The third star has node 10 as center with nodes 11,12,13,14 as peripherals. Each of these formations shows the characteristic one-to-many connection pattern typical of star topologies."
