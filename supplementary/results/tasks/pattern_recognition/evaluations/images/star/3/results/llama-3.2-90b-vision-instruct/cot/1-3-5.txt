**Step 1: Observe the overall image**

The image contains three graph charts, each representing a separate structure:

* The top-right graph consists of 5 nodes: $5$ , $6$ , $7$ , $8$ , and $9$.
* The bottom-left graph features 4 nodes: $0$ , $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , and $4$.
* The bottom-right graph has 5 nodes: $10$, $11$, $12$, $13$, and $14$.

**Step 2: Identify distinct clusters or links in each graph chart.**

In each graph chart, we find:

* Top-right graph: a cluster represented by 5 nodes: $5$ , $6$ , $7$ , $8$ , and $9$.
* Bottom-left graph: a cluster depicted by 5 nodes: $0$ , $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , and $4$.
* Bottom-right graph: a cluster shown by 5 nodes: $10$, $11$, $12$, $13$, and $14$.

**Step 3: Determine the pattern type (chain, clique, or star).**

In all three cases, a single node interconnects other nodes, while the remaining nodes do not show connections. By analyzing the specific layout and connectivity between nodes in this graph:

* We have a complete absence of interconnected nodes around a central node for the 'chain,' which is the opposite of the content in all three graph charts.

* Furthermore, the layout shows a dominant notation where the 'neighbor' nodes interact as separate entities without any interconnectivity between lower-level nodes, a common characteristic of the star pattern.

* Therefore, the graph displays the star pattern, which overrides any potential categorization as a 'clique,' which would indicate direct connectivity between the lower nodes according to the chart's layout.


**Step 4: Count the number of patterns.**

The graph contains 3 'stars,' an allocatable characteristic of this visual presentation containing this distinct node-star group. We deduce this count exists for each distinct graph chart. Given that three distinct graphs show this, we conclude that each one describes a successful instance for our count of star visual cases populated in this visual.


**Conclusion**

Our analytical findings describe: 

```
{
  'pattern': ['star'],
  'number_of_patterns': [3],
  'analysis': 'Each chart with the nodes shows a central or primary node point connected to multiple peripherals with each lower-level node represented isolated from one another, identifying a star pattern.'
}
```

Therefore, the graph structure can be best described as containing the star pattern three times, validated by unique identifiers and confirming importance that each visual instance can't be replicated or becomes a chain or clique, as this asset designates these graphs entirely occupied with visual appearances you typically identify a starred, linked node.
