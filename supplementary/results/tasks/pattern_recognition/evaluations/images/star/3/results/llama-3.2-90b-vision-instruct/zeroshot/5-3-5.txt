I don't have access to the image you are referring to. However, since you provided an image description, I'll do my best to analyze the information given.

Based on your description of the image, here is a possible response.


```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'In your graph image, you have described one node connected to three nodes, indicating a star pattern. A second node is connected to four nodes, indicating another star pattern.'
}
