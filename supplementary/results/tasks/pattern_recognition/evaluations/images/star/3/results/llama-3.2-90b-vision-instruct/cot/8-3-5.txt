**Step 1: Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.**

**Step 2: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').**

The graph consists of three groups of nodes:
- The first has nodes numbered 6, 8, 7, 5, and 9, arranged in a specific order.
- The second is centered around node 0 and includes nodes 1, 2, 4, and 3.
- The third consists of nodes 11, 10, 14, 12, and 13.

**Step 3: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.**

- There are **three** instances of the identified pattern.
- Each instance shows a specific arrangement of nodes that distinguish them from other patterns like 'chain' or 'star'.

**Step 4: Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes.**

Each of the three groups exhibits a unique arrangement, but none follow the order of a chain or have a central node characteristic of a star pattern. Instead, they seem to represent a clique-style pattern, where each node within a group might be considered independent yet part of the larger clique.

**Conclusion:**

Given the analysis, the pattern type is **clique**. There are **three** instances of this pattern in the image. The reasoning is based on observing the isolation and unique connectivity of nodes within each group, resembling characteristics of a clique pattern where each group functions as an independent unit.

**Final answer:**
```
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'Each group shows independent connectivity and isolation from other groups, resembling a clique arrangement.'
}
