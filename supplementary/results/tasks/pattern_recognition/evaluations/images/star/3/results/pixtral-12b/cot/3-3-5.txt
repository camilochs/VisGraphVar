   "analysis": "The graph has three distinct patterns, all of which are of the star type. 

   1. Observation: The nodes in each sub-graph are organized into central and peripheral nodes.
   2. Analyzing the connections: We see one central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes.
   3. Identifying patterns: 
       - The first cluster has node 10 at the center with peripheral nodes 11, 13, 12, and 14 connected to it.
       - The second cluster has node 5 at the center with peripheral nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 connected to it.
       - The third cluster has node 0 at the center with peripheral nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected to it.

   These observations confirm that all patterns in the graph fit the description of a 'star' pattern."
