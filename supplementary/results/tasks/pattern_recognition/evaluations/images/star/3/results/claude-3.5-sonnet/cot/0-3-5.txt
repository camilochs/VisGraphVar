   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star pattern has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes: 1) Node 0 is a central node connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. 2) Node 5 is a central node connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. 3) Node 10 is a central node connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. In each case, the peripheral nodes are only connected to their respective central node and not to each other, which is characteristic of a star pattern. The three star patterns are separate and not connected to each other."
