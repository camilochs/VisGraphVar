**Analysis of the Graph Image Pattern**

To identify the pattern type in the graph image, we will analyze the structure and connections between nodes.

**Pattern Type Identification**

*   The graph image contains a group of nodes (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) that are all connected to each other, forming a fully connected subgraph. This is a characteristic of a clique pattern.
*   Another group of nodes (10, 11, 12, 13, 14) also exhibits a similar fully connected structure, indicating the presence of another clique pattern.
*   In contrast, nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) do not form a clique due to the absence of a direct connection between nodes 2 and 4. Additionally, node 0 serves as the central node, connecting to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. This configuration most closely resembles a star pattern.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph image contains both clique and star patterns.
