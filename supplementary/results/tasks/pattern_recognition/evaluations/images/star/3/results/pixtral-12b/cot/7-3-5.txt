   "analysis": "1. The graph consists of four interconnected nodes: one central node and its three peripheral nodes, forming a star pattern in the upper cluster. 2. The nodes in this section are clearly a central node labeled 0, with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected to it. 3. The lower left cluster displays a similar star pattern. Here, node 10 is central, connected to peripheral nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. 4. Finally, in the lower right cluster, node 5 is central with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as peripheral nodes, also forming a star pattern. Based on this analysis, the identified pattern is 'star' and it appears three times in the graph."
