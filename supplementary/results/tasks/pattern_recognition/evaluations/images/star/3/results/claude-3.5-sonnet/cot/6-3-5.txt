   "analysis": "The graph shows three distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes: (1) Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4, (2) Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9, and (3) Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. In each case, the peripheral nodes are only connected to their respective central node and not to each other, which is characteristic of a star pattern. The layout clearly shows the hub-and-spoke arrangement typical of star topologies."
