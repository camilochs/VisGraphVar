**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

### Step 1: Observe the Structure

The graph consists of three distinct clusters:

*   Cluster 1: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
*   Cluster 2: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
*   Cluster 3: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

### Step 2: Identify Pattern Types

*   **Chain**: A sequence of nodes connected in a continuous line.
*   **Clique**: A group of nodes where every node is directly connected to every other node.
*   **Star**: A central node surrounded by peripheral nodes, with no connections between peripheral nodes.

### Step 3: Count Instances of Each Pattern

Based on the structure observed:

*   **No chain pattern** is present as there are no linear sequences of connected nodes.
*   **Three clique patterns** exist within the clusters, each forming a fully interconnected group.
*   **No star pattern** is found, as there are no central nodes surrounded by peripheral nodes without connections among them.

### Step 4: Conclusion

Given the presence of fully interconnected clusters without isolated nodes or linear sequences, the pattern type identified is 'clique.' Since there are three instances of such clusters, the number of patterns is determined as 3.

**Conclusion**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of three fully interconnected clusters, indicating the presence of clique patterns. Each cluster forms a fully connected group, leading to the identification of three clique patterns in the graph.'
