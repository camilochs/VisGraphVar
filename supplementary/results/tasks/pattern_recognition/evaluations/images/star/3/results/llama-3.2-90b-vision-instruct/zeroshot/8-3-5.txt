**Property to determine:** Type of pattern in the graph

**Available data:**

* Graph structure
* Possible patterns: chain, clique, star

**Analysis:**

After examining the graph, I observe that there is only one type of pattern present. The nodes are arranged in a circular structure, where each node is connected to every other node. This characteristic is indicative of a specific type of pattern.

**Answer:**

```json
{
  "pattern": "clique",
  "number_of_patterns": 1,
  "analysis": "The graph exhibits a circular structure where every node is connected to every other node, which is a defining feature of a clique pattern."
}
```
