    "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. The first star is centered at node 0 with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as peripherals. The second star is centered at node 5 with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as peripherals. The third star is centered at node 10 with nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 as peripherals. Each star follows the characteristic structure where one central node connects to all other nodes in its subgraph, while the peripheral nodes are only connected to the central node."
