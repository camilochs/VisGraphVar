   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct clusters, each representing a 'star' pattern. In each cluster, there is a central node (0, 5, and 10) that is connected to multiple peripheral nodes. The central node in each cluster is placed at the center, with the peripheral nodes connected to it but not to each other. The clusters are isolated from each other, with no connections between them. This characteristic layout and lack of connections between peripheral nodes confirm the 'star' pattern."
