**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we need to analyze its structure and connectivity.

**Step 1: Identify the Graph Structure**

The graph consists of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. To determine if it's a chain, clique, or star, we must examine how these components are arranged.

**Step 2: Check for Chain Pattern**

A chain pattern involves nodes connected sequentially one after another without any branches. Looking at the graph, there are multiple nodes connected sequentially without branching, indicating potential chain patterns.

**Step 3: Check for Clique Pattern**

A clique is a subgraph where every node is directly connected to every other node, forming a fully connected subset. Upon inspection, the graph does not exhibit cliques since not all nodes are directly connected to each other.

**Step 4: Check for Star Pattern**

A star pattern features one central node connected to all other nodes, which are not interconnected among themselves. The provided graph does not have a central node from which all paths originate, ruling out the star pattern.

**Conclusion**

Based on the sequential connection of nodes without full interconnectivity or a central connecting node, the pattern identified in the graph is a **chain**. Given the graph's structure, there appears to be **one continuous chain**. The **analysis** leading to this conclusion involves recognizing the absence of full interconnectivity characteristic of a clique and the lack of a central hub typical of a star pattern, along with identifying sequential node connections indicative of a chain.
