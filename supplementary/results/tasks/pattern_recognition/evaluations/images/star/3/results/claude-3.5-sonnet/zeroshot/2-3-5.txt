   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes in a radial fashion. The first star has node 5 as center connecting to nodes 8,9,7,6. The second star has node 0 as center connecting to nodes 1,2,3,4. The third star has node 10 as center connecting to nodes 12,13,14,11. In each case, the peripheral nodes are only connected to their respective central node, which is characteristic of a star pattern."
