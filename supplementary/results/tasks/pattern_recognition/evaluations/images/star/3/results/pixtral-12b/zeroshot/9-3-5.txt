   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each node is labeled and surrounded by its connections. The central node in each pattern is connected to multiple peripheral nodes, showing characteristics of a star pattern. The top-left cluster (nodes 11, 10, 14, 13, and 12) and the bottom-right cluster (nodes 2, 1, 3, 4, and the central node labeled 0) exhibit this pattern. Additionally, the top-right cluster (nodes 6, 5, 7, 8, and 9) forms another star around the central node labeled 5."
