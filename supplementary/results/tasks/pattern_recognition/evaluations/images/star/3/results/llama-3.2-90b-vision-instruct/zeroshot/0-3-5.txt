Analysis of the pattern type in the given graph image.

**Pattern Type:** Clique

**Number of Patterns:** 3

**Analysis:**

The graph image contains three distinct patterns, each exhibiting the characteristics of a clique. A clique is a subset of vertices in an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. In this graph, each pattern consists of a group of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

**Pattern 1:**

| Vertex | Adjacent Vertices |
| --- | --- |
| 4    | 0, 1, 2, 3        |
| 0    | 4, 1, 2, 3        |
| 1    | 4, 0, 2, 3        |
| 2    | 4, 0, 1, 3        |
| 3    | 4, 0, 1, 2        |

**Pattern 2:**

| Vertex | Adjacent Vertices |
| --- | --- |
| 14   | 11, 10, 12, 13   |
| 11   | 14, 10, 12, 13   |
| 10   | 14, 11, 12, 13   |
| 12   | 14, 11, 10, 13   |
| 13   | 14, 11, 10, 12   |

**Pattern 3:**

| Vertex | Adjacent Vertices |
| --- | --- |
| 9    | 8, 5, 6, 7        |
| 8    | 9, 5, 6, 7        |
| 5    | 9, 8, 6, 7        |
| 6    | 9, 8, 5, 7        |
| 7    | 9, 8, 5, 6        |

In each pattern, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, fulfilling the criteria for a clique. Therefore, the graph image contains three cliques.
