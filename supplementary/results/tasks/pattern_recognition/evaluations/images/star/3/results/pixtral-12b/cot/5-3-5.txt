   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct clusters, each containing four nodes. Upon inspecting the layout, each cluster has one central node connected to three peripheral nodes. This arrangement indicates that these clusters are stars.\n
   1. The first star has the central node 5 connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.\n
   2. The second star has the central node 0 connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.\n
   3. The third star has the central node 10 connected to nodes 11, 12, and 13.\n
   This follows the pattern definition of a central node with surrounding nodes."
