**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the graph in the provided image**

In the upper section of the graph, there are five nodes connected to a central node: 10. Each of these five nodes is further connected to only one other node: 12, 13, 11, 10 (already connected), and 14, respectively.

Therefore, in the upper part of the graph, there is a Центральноype- ...

**Step 2: Analyze other suitable patterns**

Chain: A "chain" pattern would mean multiple nodes are both connected only to exactly two other nodes and all arranged linearly next to or near each other. There could be chains wonly two nodes. However, the structure of our graph is more consistent with a сentral pattern, rather than with this "chain" pattern.

Clique: A "clique" pattern would meany of nodes is fully interconnected. While the nodes in the upper part of the graph are, indeed, fully interconnected, the presence of other additional nodes (11 and 14) here complicates the consideration of whether the five nodes are fully interconnected in a "clique"-type pattern.

Noitensen lineqat these observations (both nodes 1 and 6 are connected to the same one node, 4, for example) do suggest evidence, to some extent, in the lower-most part of our graph of a chain-type pattern developing in this manner as well, we would need to underresearch this hypothesis in our analysis, at some deeper level and then more accurately, optionally with the aid of a mathematical modeling method.

**Step 3: Based on the observations that the nodes in the upper part of the graph are centrally connected, state the name of this pattern**

The presence of a central point wouldn't rule out other patterns. Yet, if the central node were having further position that would contradict the other patterns like chain needing dimensions only relating to 2 nodes matches the best with a central pattern.

The lower part still does not match the criteria of any of these patterns as all these concepts are addressed for each set separately whereas one cannot address all nodes whether central or not at once. Central's presence for nodes still seems & is identical to nodes 1 and 6 connected to the same, above-mentioned, central node 4

**Step 4: Explain why the pattern was chosen**

In a star pattern, one central node has a connection to every other node. In the upper-mid of our graph image with five nodes connected to 10, including four additional nodes, nodes 11 and 14, to the six in that central area: For these reasons, the star pattern is the best fit.

**Step 5: Calculate the number of patterns**

There are 2 distinctly grouped patterns:

The star pattern only appears in the upper part
The other two patterns seem to be more distantly placed and nothing conclusively supports their existence in the structure. Besides, these other two patterns denote topology with optimal values of nodes two each.

**Conclusion**

We identify this pattern in the graph image as a star-type pattern with regular characteristics including a central point.

So, there are two stars.

*Answer*: ```{"pattern": "star", "number_of_patterns": "2", "analysis": "topology is similar, but the central star with optimal set consisting of nodes 10 and 14 connected to 11 and 12. "}```
