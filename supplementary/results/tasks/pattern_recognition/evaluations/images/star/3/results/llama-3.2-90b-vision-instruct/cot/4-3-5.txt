I'm sorry, but I cannot view or analyze a graph image. However, I can provide a response template based on the provided steps.



**Response Template:**

```json
{
   "pattern": "[pattern name]",
   "number_of_patterns": [number],
   "analysis": "Given the graph's structure, the presence or absence of distinct clusters, groups, or links were considered. The interconnectedness of nodes in either a continuous sequence, fully interconnected without isolated nodes, or a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes was assessed. Based on these observations, the identified pattern is determined to occur [number] times within the image, as explained by the relationships among nodes in the layout."
}
```


Please provide the graph image to assist with its analysis.
