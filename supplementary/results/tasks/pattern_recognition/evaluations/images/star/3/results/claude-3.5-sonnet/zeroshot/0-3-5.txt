    "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. The first star has node 0 as center connecting to nodes 1,2,3,4. The second star has node 5 as center connecting to nodes 6,7,8,9. The third star has node 10 as center connecting to nodes 11,12,13,14. Each central node acts as a hub with radiating connections, which is characteristic of a star pattern."
