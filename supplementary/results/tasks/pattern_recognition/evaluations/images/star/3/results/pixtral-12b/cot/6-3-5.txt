To analyze the graph image and identify the pattern type, follow these steps carefully:

1. **Observe the structure:**
   - The image contains three distinct clusters of nodes separated by white space.

2. **Identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**
   - The top cluster contains nodes labeled 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
   - The middle cluster contains nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - The bottom cluster contains nodes labeled 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

3. **Determine the pattern:**
   - **Top Cluster:** Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 are linked to the central node 10. This layout resembles a 'star' pattern where node 10 is the central node with all others connected to it.
   - **Middle Cluster:** Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all connected to the central node 0. This layout also looks like a 'star' with node 0 at the center.
   - **Bottom Cluster:** Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to node 5 in a manner where node 5 is the central node. Similar to the previous clusters, this represents a 'star' pattern with node 5 at the center.

4. **Count the instances:**
   - There are three distinct clusters, and each forms a 'star' pattern.

5. **Explain the reasoning:**
   - Each cluster consists of a central node with peripheral nodes connected to it.
   - This structure is well defined by the 'star' pattern in graph theory.

Based on this analysis, the pattern type identified is the 'star' pattern:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": [3],
   "analysis": "The graph consists of distinct clusters where each cluster forms a star pattern. In graph theory, a star pattern is defined as a central node with multiple peripheral nodes all connected to the central node. The clusters identified in the image each fit this description, with three clusters containing nodes labeled 10, 0, and 5 as their respective central nodes."
