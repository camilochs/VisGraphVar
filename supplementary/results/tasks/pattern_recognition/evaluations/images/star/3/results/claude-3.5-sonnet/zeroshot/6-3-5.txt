   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. Specifically, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4; node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9; and node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. In each case, the peripheral nodes are only connected to their respective central node, which is a defining characteristic of a star pattern."
