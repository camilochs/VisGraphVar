   "analysis": "The graph shows three distinct star patterns. 1) The first star is centered at node 0 with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as peripheral nodes. 2) The second star is centered at node 5 with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as peripheral nodes. 3) The third star is centered at node 10 with nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 as peripheral nodes. Each star pattern has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes in a spoke-like arrangement, with no connections between the peripheral nodes themselves. The consistent structure of one central node connected to multiple outer nodes clearly identifies these as star patterns."
