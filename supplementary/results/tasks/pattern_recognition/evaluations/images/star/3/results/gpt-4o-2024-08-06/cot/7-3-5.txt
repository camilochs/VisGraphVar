   "analysis": "There are three distinct clusters, each resembling a star pattern. In each cluster, there is a central node connected to several peripheral nodes. The first star pattern has node 0 at the center with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 surrounding it. The second star pattern has node 5 at the center with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 surrounding it. The third star pattern has node 10 at the center with nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 surrounding it. Each of these clusters does not form any isolated nodes or interconnected cliques but rather forms a clear central-peripheral relationship typical of a star pattern."
