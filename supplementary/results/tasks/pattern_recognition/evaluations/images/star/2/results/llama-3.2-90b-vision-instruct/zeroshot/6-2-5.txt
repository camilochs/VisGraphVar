**Graph Type Identification and Analysis**

Here is the resulting JSON object:

```json
{
    "pattern": ["star"],
    "number_of_patterns": 2,
    "analysis": "The graph contains two star patterns, one centered at node 0 with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 connected to it, and another centered at node 5 with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 connected to it. These patterns are characterized by a central node connected to multiple surrounding nodes."
}
```

This object identifies the graph pattern type as a "star" pattern, occurred twice, and provides a brief explanation of the features that led to this conclusion.
