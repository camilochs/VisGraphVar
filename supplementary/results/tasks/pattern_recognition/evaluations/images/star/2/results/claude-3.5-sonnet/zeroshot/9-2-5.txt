   "analysis": "The graph contains two distinct star patterns. The first star is centered at node 0 with four nodes (1,2,3,4) connected to it. The second star is centered at node 5 with four nodes (6,7,8,9) connected to it. In both cases, the central nodes (0 and 5) act as hubs with multiple edges radiating outward to peripheral nodes, which is characteristic of a star pattern."
