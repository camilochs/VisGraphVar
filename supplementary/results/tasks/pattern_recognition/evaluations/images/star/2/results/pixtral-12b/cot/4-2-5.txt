To analyze the graph image and determine the type of pattern, we will follow these steps:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**
   - left side graph: Nodes 8, 9, 5, 6, 7 are interconnected.
   - right side graph: Nodes 4, 1, 0, 2, 3 are interconnected.

2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star'):**
   - **Left graph:**
     - 8 is connected directly to 9 and 5. 
     - 9 is connected to 5.
     - 6 and 7 are connected to 5 but not to 8 or 9.
     - This structure more closely resembles a 'star' with 5 as the central node, where 6 and 7 are sort of peripheral because they are not directly connected to 8 or each other.
   
   - **Right graph:**
     - 4 is connected directly to 0.
     - 1 and 2 are both connected to 0.
     - 3 is connected to 0, but not to 1, 2, or 4.
     - This structure resembles a 'star' with 0 as the central node, while 3 is peripheral as it is not connected to any other node except 0.

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:**
   - There is 1 instance of the 'star' pattern on the left graph.
   - There is 1 instance of the 'star' pattern on the right graph.

4. **Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes:**
   - **Left graph:** The central node (5) is connected directly to nodes 8 and 9 (forming a star with these), while 6 and 7 are indirectly connected and do not form any continuous chain or clique.
   - **Right graph:**  The central node (0) is connected to 1, 2, and 4, and node 3 is considered part of this overall structure but not connected to the other four, thus forming another star with 0 as the central node.

Thus, the identified patterns are both characteristics of a star pattern:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": [2],
   "analysis": "By analyzing both the left and right graphs, it is evident that in each graph one central node is connected to multiple peripheral nodes, forming a star structure. In the left graph, node 5 serves as the central node connecting to nodes 8, and 9. In the right graph, node 0 serves as the central node connecting to nodes 1, 2, and 4, with node 3 being peripheral as it is only connected directly to node 0 and not to others."
}
