**Analysis of the Graph Image**

Given the provided graph, it demonstrates a chain pattern.

**Answer:**

{
    "pattern": "chain",
    "number_of_patterns": "2",
    "analysis": "The graph has two distinct chains. The first chain, located in the lower left corner, consists of nodes (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), and (9, 8). The second chain, situated in the upper right corner, comprises nodes (0, 2), (2, 4), (4, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 3). Each chain has at least three connected edges, defining them as chains."
