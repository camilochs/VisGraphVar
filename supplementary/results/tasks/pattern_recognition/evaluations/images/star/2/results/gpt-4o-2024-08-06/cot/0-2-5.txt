   "analysis": "There are two distinct clusters in the graph image. The first cluster consists of node 0 as a central node connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is a star pattern because all peripheral nodes are directly connected to the central node but not to each other. The second cluster consists of node 5 as a central node connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9, again forming a star pattern. In each case, there's no interconnection among peripheral nodes, confirming the star pattern format."
