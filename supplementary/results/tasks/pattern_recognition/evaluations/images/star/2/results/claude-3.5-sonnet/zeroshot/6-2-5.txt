    "analysis": "The graph contains two star patterns. The first star is centered at node 0 with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as its endpoints. The second star is centered at node 5 with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as its endpoints. In both cases, the central nodes (0 and 5) connect to multiple nodes while the endpoint nodes only connect to their respective central node, which is characteristic of a star pattern."
