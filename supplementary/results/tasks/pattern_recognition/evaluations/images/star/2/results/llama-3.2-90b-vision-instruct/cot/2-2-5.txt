The graph image presents a structured sequence of nodes and lines, characteristic of a 'chain' pattern. This pattern is defined by interconnected nodes forming a continuous sequence, with each node linked directly to its preceding and succeeding nodes without any isolated or disconnected elements.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**

* The graph features a series of nodes (represented by symbols or icons) arranged in a linear fashion, with each node connected to the next via lines.
* There are no isolated nodes that do not connect to any other node or group of nodes, which aligns with the definition of a 'chain' pattern.
* All nodes connect to each other in a continuous sequence, forming a singular chain.

**Conclusion**

* **Pattern Type**: chain
* **Number of Patterns**: 1
* **Analysis**: The graph's linear arrangement of interconnected nodes, with no isolated nodes or subgroups, indicates a single instance of a 'chain' pattern.
