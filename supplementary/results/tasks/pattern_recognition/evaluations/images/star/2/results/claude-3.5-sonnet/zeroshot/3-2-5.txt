    "analysis": "The graph contains two distinct star patterns. The first star is centered at node 5 with four outer nodes (6, 7, 8, 9) connected to it. The second star is centered at node 0 with four outer nodes (1, 2, 3, 4) connected to it. In both cases, the central nodes serve as hubs with multiple nodes radiating from them, which is characteristic of the star pattern."
