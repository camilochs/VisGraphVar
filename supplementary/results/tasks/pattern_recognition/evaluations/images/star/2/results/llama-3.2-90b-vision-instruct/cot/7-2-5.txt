**Pattern Identification and Analysis**

Based on the graph structure, we can identify distinct clusters, groups, or links that help us determine the pattern type.

**Identified Pattern:**

*   The pattern is a star.
    *   The graph structure exhibits a prominent central node with surrounding peripheral nodes, characteristic of a star pattern.
    *   Notably, the central node is not continuously connected in a sequence nor are all nodes interlinked without isolated nodes.

**Number of Patterns:**

*   There are 2 instances of the star pattern.

**Reasoning for the Identified Pattern:**

*   The structure of the graph clearly illustrates central nodes with surrounding peripheral nodes, aligning with the definition of a star pattern.
*   Upon careful analysis, the nodes do not form a continuous sequence indicative of a chain pattern, nor do they display full interconnectivity characteristic of a clique.
