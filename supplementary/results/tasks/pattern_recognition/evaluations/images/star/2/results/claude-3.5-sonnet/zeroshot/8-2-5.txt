    "analysis": "The graph contains two distinct star patterns. The first star is centered at node 0 with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as endpoints. The second star is centered at node 5 with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 as endpoints. Both formations show the characteristic star pattern where a central node connects to multiple peripheral nodes that are not connected to each other."
