   "analysis": "Step 1: Observing the structure, we note two distinct clusters of nodes.

Step 2: For the first cluster (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4), Node 0 is the central node with direct connections to Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. This structure shows Node 0 as a central hub and other nodes forming a periphery. 

Similarly, for the second cluster (Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), Node 5 is the central node with direct connections to Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. Again, Node 5 forms the central hub while the other nodes are peripheral.

Step 3: Counting instances, we see there are two such clusters in the image where nodes are central with peripheral nodes connected directly to them.

Therefore, the graph patterns identified are both of type 'star' due to the central node having direct connections to all its peripherally connected nodes."
