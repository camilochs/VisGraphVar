**Pattern Analysis**

To analyze the pattern in the graph image, we need to identify the connectivity of the nodes and their arrangement.

**Step 1: Node Connectivity**

*   Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
*   Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.

**Step 2: Pattern Identification**

Based on the connectivity and arrangement of the nodes, we notice that nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are directly connected to node 0, and nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 are directly connected to node 5. This indicates a central node with multiple connections, which is characteristic of a star graph pattern.

**Conclusion**

Given the connectivity and arrangement of the nodes, we can conclude that the pattern in the graph image is a "star" pattern.
