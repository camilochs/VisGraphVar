  "pattern": ["star"],
  "number_of_patterns": [2],
  "analysis": "The graph consists of two disconnected components. Each component has a central node connected to all other nodes within that component. In the first component, node 0 is the central node connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the second component, node 5 is the central node connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.  There are no continuous sequences (chains) or fully interconnected groups (cliques), so 'star' is the correct pattern, appearing twice."
