**Pattern Analysis**

Based on the image, the identified pattern is a **star**. This conclusion is drawn from the visual structure of the graph, where a central node is surrounded by peripheral nodes connected only to it.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Central Node:** The central node in question is labeled "0". It is the node that directly connects to other nodes without forming a continuous chain or completely connecting all nodes in a clique.

2. **Peripheral Nodes:** Nodes labeled "1", "2", "3", and "4" directly connect to the central node "0". These are the peripheral nodes of the star pattern.

3. **Star Pattern Identification:** A star pattern is defined by a central node connected to multiple nodes without forming a chain or clique. In this case, "0" serves as the central node, making this a star pattern.

4. **Number of Instances:** Since there's only one set of a central node directly connected to peripheral nodes, there is **one instance** of the star pattern in the image.

5. **Conclusion:** The image depicts a single star pattern centered around node "0" with multiple peripheral nodes ("1", "2", "3", "4") connecting only to it, fitting the definition of a star pattern in graph theory.

**JSON Response:**
```json
{
    "pattern": ["star"],
    "number_of_patterns": 1,
    "analysis": "The graph features a central node labeled '0' connected to surrounding nodes without forming a chain or clique, fitting the definition of a star pattern."
}
```
Final Answer: The final answer is a star pattern.
