Based on the analysis of the graph image, I've identified the pattern type as follows:

```json
{
  "pattern": ["clique", "star"],
  "number_of_patterns": [1, 1],
  "analysis": "The top-right cluster forms a clique with nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 fully interconnected without isolated nodes. The bottom-left cluster represents a star pattern with node 0 as the central node and surrounding nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4."
}
```

Explanation:

*   I observed two distinct clusters in the graph image: one at the top-right and another at the bottom-left.
*   For the top-right cluster, I noticed that all nodes (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) are interconnected without any isolated nodes, which indicates a clique pattern.
*   In the bottom-left cluster, I identified a central node (0) surrounded by peripheral nodes (1, 2, 3, and 4), characteristic of a star pattern.

Therefore, the graph image contains one instance of a clique pattern and one instance of a star pattern.
