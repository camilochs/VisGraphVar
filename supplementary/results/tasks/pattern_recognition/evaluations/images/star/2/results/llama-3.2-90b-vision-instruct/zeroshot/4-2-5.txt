**Graph Pattern Analysis**

### Step 1: Identify the Graph Structure

The graph image displays two separate clusters of nodes connected by edges.

### Step 2: Analyze the Clusters

* One cluster represents a "chain" containing nodes 8, 9, 5, 6, and 7.
* The other cluster forms a "star" pattern with nodes 4, 1, 0, 2, and 3, centered around node 0.

### Step 3: Determine the Pattern Type and Count

Both a "chain" pattern and a "star" pattern are identified in the graph. There is one instance of each pattern type.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the graph contains both a "chain" and a "star" pattern.

**Answer:** 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'The graph contains both a chain and a star pattern.'
}
