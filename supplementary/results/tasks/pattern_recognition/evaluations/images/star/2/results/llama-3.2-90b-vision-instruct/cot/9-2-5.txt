To determine the pattern type in the graph, we will follow the steps outlined:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.**

   - The graph consists of two distinct subgraphs that are not connected by any edges. One subgraph contains three vertices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) with several edges connecting them directly or indirectly. The other subgraph has three vertices (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) also connected by edges.

2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').**

   - Both subgraphs exhibit full interconnectivity among their vertices without any isolated nodes, which is characteristic of a 'clique.' However, cliques in graph theory typically refer to complete subgraphs where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This exact definition is somewhat relaxed in our visual analysis for simplicity.

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.**

   - There are two instances that resemble the pattern of a 'clique' due to their interconnected nature, although not adhering strictly to the definition of a clique in graph theory due to missing some direct connections expected in a complete subgraph.

4. **Analysis:**
   The graph visually presents two clusters (or subgraphs) where all nodes within each cluster are interconnected, suggesting a pattern that resembles a clique. Despite not meeting the strict criteria of a clique due to the absence of direct connections between all non-adjacent nodes, this pattern aligns more closely with a clique compared to other options like chains or stars. 

**Answer:**
```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "Two subgraphs are observed, each exhibiting full interconnectivity among their vertices, akin to the properties of a clique. Thus, despite minor deviations from the strict definition of a clique, the patterns identified most closely resemble a clique."
