Analysis of the Graph Pattern

Based on the graph provided, the following characteristics are identified:

* The graph consists of two connected components:
	+ The first component is a "star" pattern comprising node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
	+ The second component is a "clique" pattern comprising nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

**Conclusion**

The graph exhibits multiple patterns. The identified features of the graph align with both a "star" and a "clique" pattern.

**Answer**

```json
{
   "pattern": ["star", "clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "One of the connected components in the graph follows the star pattern, and the other resembles a clique."
}
