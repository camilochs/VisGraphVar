The graph depicted consists of two separate, non-overlapping subgraphs. 

* The first subgraph consists of nodes 1, 2, and 3, all of which are connected to each other, thereby forming a "clique" pattern. 
* The second subgraph consists of nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, all of which are connected to node 5 but not to each other, thereby forming a "star" pattern.

Therefore, the graph contains both a "clique" and a "star" pattern.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1,1],
   'analysis': 'The clique pattern is formed in the subgraph with nodes 1, 2, and 3, whereas the star pattern is formed in the subgraph with nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.'
}
