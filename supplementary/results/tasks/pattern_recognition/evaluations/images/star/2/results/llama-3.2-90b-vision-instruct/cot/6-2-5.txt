**Step 1: Identify pattern**

To identify the pattern, we will analyze the graph structure and the relationships among nodes.

The graph has 9 nodes and the number of edges is 8.

We can see that there are two distinct clusters in the graph.

In the left cluster, node 5 is a central node connected to three surrounding peripheral nodes (6, 7, and 8). Node 8 also has a connection to node 9.

In the right cluster, node 0 is also a central node connected to three surrounding peripheral nodes (1, 2, 3). Node 2 also has a connection to node 4.

The graph formed resembles a star shape because all of the peripheral nodes are connected to a central node.

**Step 2: Spoecify the pattern type, the count, and the reasoning specified in JSON format.**
