   'analysis': 'The graph contains two distinct \'star\' patterns. Each star has a central node with branches connecting to four additional nodes. The top graph shows a central node labeled \'0\' with nodes \'1\', \'2\', \'3\', and \'4\' as branches. Similarly, the bottom graph features a central node labeled \'5\' with nodes \'6\', \'7\', \'8\', and \'9\' as branches. These structural features define the star patterns clearly.'
