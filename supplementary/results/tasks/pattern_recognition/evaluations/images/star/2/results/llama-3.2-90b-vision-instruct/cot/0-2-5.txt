**Property to determine:** Pattern type in the graph image.

**Available data:**

* The graph consists of two disconnected components.
* Each component has its own set of interconnected nodes.

**Analysis:**

* In the top-right section, node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. This forms a clique because all nodes are directly connected to each other.
* In the bottom-left section, node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. This also forms a clique for the same reason.

**Conclusion:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2],
   'analysis': "The graph contains two separate groups where every node within each group is directly connected to the others, fitting the definition of a clique."
}
```

This analysis correctly identifies the graph structure as comprising two isolated cliques.
