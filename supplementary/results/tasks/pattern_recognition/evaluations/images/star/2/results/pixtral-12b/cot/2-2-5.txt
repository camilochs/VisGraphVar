            2. Identified pattern type: 'star' for each sub-graph, observed by central nodes 0 and 5 connected to their respective peripheral nodes (1, 2, 3, 4) in the first sub-graph and (6, 7, 8, 9) in the second sub-graph.\n
            3. Counted instances of the identified pattern: two stars.\n
            4. Reasoning: The layout of both sets of nodes around a central node marks them as stars."
