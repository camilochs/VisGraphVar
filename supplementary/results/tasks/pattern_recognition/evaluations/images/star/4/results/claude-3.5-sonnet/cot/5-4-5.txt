   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct star patterns. 1) Node 5 is a central node connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, and 6. 2) Node 0 is a central node connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. 3) Node 10 is a central node connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14. 4) Node 15 is a central node connected to nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19. Each of these subgraphs follows a star pattern where one central node connects to multiple peripheral nodes, and the peripheral nodes are not connected to each other."
