**Property to Determine:** Type of pattern in the graph

**Relevant Data:**

* The graph consists of multiple subgraphs.
* Each subgraph has a central node connected to two or more nodes.
* There are no connections between nodes of different subgraphs.

**Analysis:**
The presence of multiple central nodes connected to two or more nodes but not connecting across subgraphs indicates a 'star' pattern within each subgraph. This is characteristic of a star pattern, where one central node connects directly to other nodes without those nodes (the "singles") connecting to each other or nodes in other subgraphs.

**Conclusion:**
Given the characteristics described, the graph contains 'star' patterns. There are multiple instances of these patterns since there are multiple central nodes fulfilling the criteria of being connected to other nodes directly but not sharing those connections across subgraphs.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
  'pattern': ['star'],
  'number_of_patterns': 4,
  'analysis': 'The graph shows multiple subgraphs each with a central node connected to other nodes without those connections extending between subgraphs, fitting the definition of a star pattern.'
}
```
