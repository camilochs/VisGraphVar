The graph layout is characterized by the presence of four separate clusters, with no connections between them. Each cluster features a distinct spatial organization:

* Top-left cluster: a centralized node surrounded by peripheral nodes
* Top-right cluster: a centralized node surrounded by peripheral nodes
* Bottom-left cluster: a centralized node surrounded by peripheral nodes
* Bottom-right cluster: a centralized node surrounded by peripheral nodes

This network structure is known as a "star" pattern, defined by a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. Since there are four identical clusters, the total number of "star" patterns is four.

{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'The graph layout is characterized by the presence of four separate clusters, with no connections between them.
