**Pattern Analysis**

Based on the graph image, we observe the following pattern:

*   A chain of interconnected nodes, each connected to every other node within the group.
*   The graph exhibits multiple groups with each node connected to every other node within the respective group.

**Conclusion**

The pattern in the graph is a **clique**. Multiple cliques are identified, each comprising a set of fully connected nodes. The presence of multiple cliques indicates a distributed network structure where all nodes within a clique are closely connected.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
    'pattern': ['clique'],
    'number_of_patterns': [4],
    'analysis': 'We observe 4 instances of cliques, which define a fully connected graph. Each node within a group is connected to all the others.'
}
