  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to three or four peripheral nodes. These central nodes are 15, 0, 5, and 10. Other connections are absent, confirming the star pattern. Therefore, the graph presents four clear instances of the star pattern."
