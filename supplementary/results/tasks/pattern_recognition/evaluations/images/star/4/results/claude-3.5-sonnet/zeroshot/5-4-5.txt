    "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct star patterns: 1) Node 5 is connected to nodes 7,8,9,6; 2) Node 0 is connected to nodes 1,2,3,4; 3) Node 10 is connected to nodes 11,12,13,14; and 4) Node 15 is connected to nodes 16,17,18,19. Each of these subgraphs shows a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes in a star-like configuration, which is characteristic of the star pattern."
