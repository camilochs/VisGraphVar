   "analysis": "The graph contains several groups of nodes. Each group consists of a central node connected to several peripheral nodes, forming a 'star' pattern. There are four star patterns identified: (1) node 15 connected to nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19; (2) node 10 connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14; (3) node 5 connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9; (4) node 0 connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each star pattern is characterized by a central node with multiple connections emanating to peripheral nodes without interconnections among them."
