These are the patterns' type that would be on the desired graph image:

1. **Chain Pattern**

If the graph image displays a series of nodes or vertices connected in a sequential manner, where each node is linked directly to its preceding and succeeding nodes, forming a linear or chain-like structure, the pattern can be identified as a 'chain'.

2. **Clique Pattern**

If the graph image shows a group of nodes that are all connected to each other, with every node within the group having a direct edge or connection to every other node in the group, indicating a fully connected subset of nodes, the pattern can be identified as a 'clique'.

3. **Star Pattern**

If the graph image features a central node connected to multiple other nodes, but none of these peripheral nodes are directly connected to each other, resembling a central hub with radiating spokes, the pattern can be identified as a 'star'.

The final answer is:

```
{
  "pattern": ["chain", "clique", "star"],
  "number_of_patterns": ["1", "1", "2"],
  "analysis": "Each pattern type is identified based on the arrangement and connectivity of the nodes within the graph image."
}
```
