The graph appears to be a collection of disconnected subgraphs. Let's examine each subgraph:

1.  The top-left subgraph has nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is a fully connected subgraph since every node is directly connected to every other node. This meets the definition of a clique.
2.  The top-right subgraph includes nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Node 0 is connected to 1, 2, 3, and 4. Node 1 is connected to 0 and 4. Node 3 is connected to 0 and 4. Node 4 is connected to 0, 1, and 3. Node 2 is not connected to any other node except 0. This does not form a clique or a chain because it does not meet the criteria for either pattern.
3.  The bottom-left subgraph includes nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Node 10 is connected to 11, 12, 13, and 14. Node 12 is connected to 10, 11, and 13. Node 13 is connected to 10, 12, and 14. Node 14 is connected to 10, 11, and 13. Node 11 is connected to 10, 12, and 14. This subgraph forms a clique.
4.  The bottom-right subgraph includes nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.  Node 15 is connected to 16, 17, 18, and 19. Node 16 is connected to 15 and 17. Node 17 is connected to 15 and 18. Node 18 is connected to 15 and 17. Node 19 is not connected to any other node except 15. This pattern matches a star because a central node (15) is connected to all other nodes in the subgraph, and these outer nodes are not connected to each other.
5.  We have one star pattern and two clique patterns. The subgraph in the top-right corner does not clearly fit the 'chain,' 'clique,' or 'star' categories as defined.

In conclusion, the type of pattern in this image is star' with 1 number of patterns and two clique patterns.

```json
{
    "pattern": ["star", "clique"],
    "number_of_patterns": [1, 2],
    "analysis": "Star pattern identified by one central node connected to every other node in a subgraph. Clique pattern identified by all nodes being directly connected."
}
```

Note that the format you specified does not accommodate multiple pattern types or their counts elegantly. The provided response adapts to adhere to the requested format as closely as possible while still conveying the analysis findings.
