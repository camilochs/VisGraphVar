Based on a careful analysis of the graph image, we can identify the distinct patterns present. Here are the steps and reasoning involved:

1. **Observe the Structure**:
   - The graph consists of four separate clusters of nodes.
   - Each cluster has nodes either connected to a central node, forming a star-like shape.

2. **Determine the Pattern Type**:
   - The nodes in each cluster are interconnected through a central node, which indicates that these clusters resemble the 'star' pattern.

3. **Count the Instances**:
   - There are a total of four clusters, each resembling a star pattern.

4. **Explanation of the Layout**:
   - Each star pattern has a central node connected directly to several peripheral nodes. For example:
     - The top-left cluster has node 1 as the central node with nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 as peripheral nodes.
     - The top-right cluster has node 10 as the central node with nodes 11, 13, 12, and 14 as peripheral nodes.
     - The bottom-right cluster has node 5 as the central node with nodes 7, 6, 8, and 9 as peripheral nodes.
     - The bottom-left cluster has node 15 as the central node with nodes 16, 19, 17, and 18 as peripheral nodes.
