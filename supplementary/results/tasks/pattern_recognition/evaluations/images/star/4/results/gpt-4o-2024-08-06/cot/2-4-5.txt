In the top-left subgraph, node 10 is the center connected to 11, 12, 13, and 14, forming a star pattern. The top-right subgraph has node 0 as the center with connections to 1, 2, 3, and 4, also forming a star pattern. The bottom-left subgraph has node 5 as the center connected to 6, 7, 8, and 9, forming another star pattern. In the bottom-right subgraph, node 15 is the center connected to 16, 17, 18, and 19, completing the fourth star pattern. Each subgraph features a central node connected to all others, without any additional edges between peripheral nodes."
