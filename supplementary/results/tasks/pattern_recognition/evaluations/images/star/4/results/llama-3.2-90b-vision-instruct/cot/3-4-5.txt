**Pattern Identification and Analysis**

To identify the pattern in the given graph, we will follow the steps outlined below.

### Step 1: Pattern Identification

Upon examining the graph, we observe that there are several disconnected clusters with nodes connected in a circular fashion. Each cluster contains a central node with various interconnected nodes forming a closed loop directly linked to the central node, along with a few central nodes having peripheral nodes without any links to distant nodes.

**Against the criteria for chain, clique, and star patterns**:

*   A chain is a sequence of connected nodes in one line. This does not apply since there are all loops from the nodes to the same central node.
*   Fully interconnected nodes (clique) without isolated nodes will not suffice given isolated nodes.
*   Presence of all peripheral nodes joining to different central nodes with a distance from other central nodes, more resembling a star pattern.

Given the peripheral nodes to various central nodes, these pattern forming instances are considered a star.

**Step 2: Counting Pattern Occurrences**

We have carefully counted the number of star patterns in the graph. Based on our analysis, there are **4** instances of the 'star' pattern.

**Step 3: Response**

Here is the final response in JSON format:

```json
{
   "pattern": "star",
   "number_of_patterns": 4,
   "analysis": "We identified that the graph consists of star patterns where each pattern has a central node with peripheral nodes connected to it without any links to distant nodes."
}
```

**Conclusion**

Based on the steps above, the graph's sprites form a total of **4 star patterns** on the given image. There are 4 circularly interconnected node clusters looping around separate central nodes with a clear distinction from the characteristics of either chain or clique patterns.
