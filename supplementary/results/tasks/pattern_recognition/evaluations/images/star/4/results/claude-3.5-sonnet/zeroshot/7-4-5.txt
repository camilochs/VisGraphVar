   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct star patterns. Each star formation has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes in a radial fashion. Specifically, we can see star patterns centered around nodes 0, 10, 5, and 15, where each central node has 3-4 connections to outer nodes that are not connected to each other."
