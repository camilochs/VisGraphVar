   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to several peripheral nodes. Specifically: (1) node 5 is connected to nodes 6,7,8,9; (2) node 0 is connected to nodes 1,2,3,4; (3) node 10 is connected to nodes 11,12,13,14; and (4) node 15 is connected to nodes 16,17,18,19. In each case, the peripheral nodes are only connected to the central node, forming the characteristic star topology."
