**Pattern Analysis**

To identify the type of pattern in the graph image, we need to analyze the structure and connections between nodes.

**Step: Identifying the pattern in the graph**

Upon examining the graph, we observe that there are multiple small graphs, each consisting of a few nodes connected together. These small graphs do not form a long chain or a fully connected clique where every node is connected to every other node.

**Step: Conclusion based on the pattern observed**

Given the presence of multiple small, separately connected groups of nodes without any evident long chain or complete connection among all nodes (a clique), it suggests that these small graphs could represent 'star' patterns. However, upon closer inspection, we realize that the groups are more characteristic of 'cliques' since every node within each group is connected to every other within the same group, but they don't fulfill the definition of a full clique because there are multiple such groups not interconnected with each other in the full-clique manner.

**Step: Conclusion and answering the question**

Therefore, the correct answer is:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains multiple independently connected groups of nodes where every node is connected to every other node within the group, indicative of clique patterns. There are 4 such groups observed in the graph presented.'
}
```
This response acknowledges the absence of a single chain or star pattern, emphasizing the dominate presence of clique patterns within the graph provided.
