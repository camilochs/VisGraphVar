Based on the image of the graph, here is the identification and analysis of the graph's pattern type:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': 'In the graph, each pattern consists of a central node connected to several peripheral nodes, indicating a \'star\' pattern. Here are the steps of the analysis:\n\n1. Observed Structure: Each cluster forms a shape with one central node and smaller nodes surrounding it.\n2. Distinct Characteristics: The interconnected nodes are clustered, and most connections lead from the central node to the peripheral nodes without forming a continuous chain or fully interconnected clique.\n3. Detailed Clusters:\n- Cluster with nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9 (with 5 at the center).\n- Cluster with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 (with 0 at the center).\n- Cluster with nodes 10, 11, 13, and 14 (with 10 at the center).\n- Cluster with nodes 15, 16, 17, and 19 (with 15 at the center).\n4. Conclusion: All these clusters indicates a pattern where each node has a central anchorage from which others radiate outwards, typical of a star pattern. Hence, the observed pattern in the graph is a star, occurring four times (one for each cluster).'
