**Pattern Identification and Explanation**

To identify the pattern type in the graph, we will follow the given steps:

*   **Step 1: Observe the Structure**
    The graph is composed of several clusters with varying numbers of interconnected nodes. Each cluster represents a distinct group within the larger graph.
*   **Step 2: Determine the Pattern Type**
    Observing the connections:
    *   Some clusters have all their nodes directly connected to each other, forming a clique.\    *   There are no chains (continuous sequences) or stars (a central node with peripheral nodes) observed across the different clusters.
*   **Step 3: Count Instances of Each Pattern**
    *   There are multiple clusters, each fitting the description of a clique due to their interconnected nature.
*   **Conclusion:**

    The graph primarily consists of clique patterns since all nodes within a cluster are interconnected without any instance of a chain or star distribution.

```json
{
    "pattern": ["clique"],
    "number_of_patterns": [4],
    "analysis": "The graph is divided into distinct clusters where every node in each cluster is directly connected to one another. This characteristic defines a clique, and there are four such clusters observed in the graph provided."
}
```

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \[JSON provided above]. I hope it is correct.
