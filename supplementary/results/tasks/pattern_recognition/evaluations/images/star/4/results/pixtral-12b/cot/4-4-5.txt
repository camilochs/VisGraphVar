   2. The nodes in each cluster do not form a continuous sequence (chain) or a fully interconnected setup without isolated nodes (clique). However, each has a central node where all other nodes in the cluster are linked.
   3. There are four such clusters in the image.
   4. Based on the layout and relationships among nodes, the identified pattern for each cluster is a "star" pattern where one central node connects to multiple peripheral nodes.'
