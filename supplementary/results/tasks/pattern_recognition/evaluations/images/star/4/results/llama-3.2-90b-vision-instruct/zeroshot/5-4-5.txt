**Step 1: Pattern Type and Count**

To determine the type of pattern in the image, let's look at the characteristics of the given pattern, along with others in the dataset, have: 

• each cycle in the dataset consists of 3 vertices

• in a star pattern, not all vertices are connected to each other. Instead, some nodes are only connected to the "center" node (e.g., 7 above).

Thus, a "common pattern" must consist of three vertices that don't all share a connection with one another. 

Based on this information, the dataset has 3 "star patterns".

**Step 2: IIIIIIIIIIIStatistics=Statistics**

Answer: 

```json
{
   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": [3],
   "analysis": "The nodes only share connections with two other nodes in the same cycle."
}
```
