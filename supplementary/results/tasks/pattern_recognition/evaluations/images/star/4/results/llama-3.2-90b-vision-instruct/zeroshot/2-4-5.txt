**Graph Analysis**

* The graph is composed of three disconnected subgraphs.
* Each subgraph has a central node connected to multiple nodes, forming a star-like pattern.

**Conclusion**

```json
{
    'pattern': 'star',
    'number_of_patterns': 3,
    'analysis': 'The presence of a central node in each subgraph, connected to multiple nodes, characterizes the star pattern type.'
}
```

This conclusion is supported by the typical structure of a star graph, which consists of a single central node connected to multiple edges.
