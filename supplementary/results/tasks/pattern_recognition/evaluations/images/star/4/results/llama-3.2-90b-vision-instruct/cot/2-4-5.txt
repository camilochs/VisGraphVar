The graph consists of four distinct patterns:

* A chain-type pattern is observed, where nodes are connected in a continuous sequence: 13-14-10-11-12 (top left) and 9-8-5-6-7 (bottom left).
* Two clique-type patterns are identified, where all nodes are interconnected without isolation: 4-0-1-2-3 (top right) and 19-18-16-17-15 (bottom right).

*Answer*: 

```json
{
    'pattern': ['chain', 'clique'],
    'number_of_patterns': [2, 2],
    'analysis': 'Two chain patterns and two clique patterns are identified through their respective layouts and relationships among the nodes.'
}
