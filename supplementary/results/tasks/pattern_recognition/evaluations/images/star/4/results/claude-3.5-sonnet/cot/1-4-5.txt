   "analysis": "The graph shows four distinct star patterns. Each star pattern has a central node connected to peripheral nodes: (1) Node 0 at the center with nodes 1,2,3,4 as peripherals; (2) Node 5 at the center with nodes 6,7,8,9 as peripherals; (3) Node 10 at the center with nodes 11,12,13,14 as peripherals; (4) Node 15 at the center with nodes 16,17,18,19 as peripherals. Each star formation has a clear center hub with radiating connections to surrounding nodes, and there are no connections between the peripheral nodes, which is characteristic of a star pattern."
