**Answer:** 

{
  "pattern": "star",
  "number_of_patterns": 4,
  "analysis": "The graph contains multiple star patterns, characterized by a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. Each central node (6, 17, 19 and 10) is surrounded by nodes that are not interconnected among themselves, forming a star-shaped structure. The presence of these distinct star patterns throughout the graph indicates a clear and repetitive pattern type."
