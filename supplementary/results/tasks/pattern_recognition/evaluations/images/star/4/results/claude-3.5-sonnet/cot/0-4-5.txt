   "analysis": "The graph shows 4 distinct star patterns. First star has node 0 as center with nodes 1,2,3,4 as peripherals. Second star has node 10 as center with nodes 11,12,13,14 as peripherals. Third star has node 5 as center with nodes 6,7,8,9 as peripherals. Fourth star has node 15 as center with nodes 16,17,18,19 as peripherals. In each case, there is a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, with no connections between the peripheral nodes themselves, which is characteristic of a star pattern. Each subgraph follows the same structural principle where all outer nodes connect only to the central node."
