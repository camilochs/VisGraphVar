   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 distinct star patterns. Each star pattern has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. Specifically, node 15 is connected to nodes 17,18,19,16; node 0 is connected to nodes 1,2,3,4; node 5 is connected to nodes 6,7,8,9; and node 10 is connected to nodes 11,12,13,14. Each central node acts as a hub with edges radiating outward to its peripheral nodes, which is characteristic of a star pattern."
