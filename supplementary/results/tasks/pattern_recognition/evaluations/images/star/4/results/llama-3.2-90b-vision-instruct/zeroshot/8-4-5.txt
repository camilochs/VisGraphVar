**Analysis of the Graph Image**

To analyze the graph image and identify the type of pattern it contains, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Identify the Graph Structure**
The graph image consists of multiple nodes connected by edges.

**Step 2: Recognize Pattern Types**
There are three possible patterns: 'chain,' 'clique,' or 'star.'

*   Chain: A sequence of nodes connected by edges, where each node is connected to only two other nodes.
*   Clique: A group of nodes where every node is connected to every other node.
*   Star: A central node connected to multiple nodes, with no connections between the surrounding nodes.

**Step 3: Analyze the Graph**
Upon examining the graph, it exhibits a star-like structure. The central node is connected to multiple nodes, and there are no connections between the surrounding nodes.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph image contains a **'star'** pattern. The central node is connected to multiple nodes, and there are no connections between the surrounding nodes.
