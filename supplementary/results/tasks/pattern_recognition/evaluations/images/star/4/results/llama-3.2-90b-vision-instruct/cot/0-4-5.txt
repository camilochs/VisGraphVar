**Pattern Identification**

* The graph consists of four clusters with varying node connections.
* Each cluster has a distinct pattern:
	+ Cluster with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4: connected in a chain-like sequence.
	+ Clusters with nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, and nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9: linked, forming a clique.
	+ Cluster with nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19: connected to each other except for node 19, attached to node 15, similar to a star pattern.

**Pattern Type and Count**

* Based on observations:
	+ 1 instance of a chain pattern
	+ 2 instances of a clique pattern
	+ 1 instance of a star-like pattern not fitting perfectly into any category

**Conclusion**

The graph exhibits a mix of different network topologies, including chain, clique, and star-like patterns.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1, 2, 1],
   'analysis': 'The graph exhibits a combination of chain, clique, and star-like patterns, with each cluster displaying different patterns.'
}
