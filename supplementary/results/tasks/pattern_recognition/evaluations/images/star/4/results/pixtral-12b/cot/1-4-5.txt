   "analysis": "1. Observing the structure in the graph image, we can see that each circle (node) is connected to every other circle within the same group CRISPR. 
2. Upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that each cluster of nodes is fully interconnected, meaning each node is directly linked to every other node in the same cluster. 
3. This forms a 'clique' pattern where every node in the group is connected and there are no isolated nodes, fulfilling the definition of a fully connected subgraph.
4. In total, there are four distinct clusters in the image, each forming a 'clique' pattern.
   Therefore, the pattern identified is a 'clique' pattern repeated four times in the graph image.
