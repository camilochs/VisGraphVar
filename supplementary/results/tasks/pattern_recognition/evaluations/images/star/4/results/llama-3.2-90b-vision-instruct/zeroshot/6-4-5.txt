I am unable to view the image. Please provide the image or describe the graph so I can determine the correct classification. I'll be happy to assist once I have a description of the image.

If the graph is a 5 node graph, I would say the following:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 1,
   'analysis': 'The graph contains 5 nodes with a node connected to every other node.'
}
```

If the graph did not contain these features, a chain might include two nodes connected to each other and two additional unconnected nodes, while a 'star' might include one connected node linked to several others. Clusters of connected nodes might be considered cliques.
