Based on the provided graph image, the detected patterns can be categorized as follows:

```json
{
   'pattern': ["star"],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': "The graph contains four distinct 'star' patterns, characterized by a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. Each cluster has one node that is connected to multiple other nodes radiating from the center."
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is divided into four distinct clusters.
- Each cluster has a central node from which other nodes radiate, implying a "star" pattern.
  - Cluster 1: Node 1 as the center with nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
  - Cluster 2: Node 5 as the center with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.
  - Cluster 3: Node 10 as the center with nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14.
  - Cluster 4: Node 15 as the center with nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19.
- Each "star" pattern fulfills the criteria of having one central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes.
