Nodes 15, 16, 18, 17 and 19 form a star with 15 as the central node.\n3. Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 form a star with 0 as the central node.\n4. Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 form a star with 5 as the central node.\nEach pattern has a central node connected to peripheral nodes. There are no interconnections between any of the peripheral nodes within the individual star pattern."
