In each cluster, the peripheral nodes are not connected to each other, which defines the 'star' pattern type. The central node is surrounded by peripheral nodes, forming four separate star patterns: 0 (central) with 1, 2, 3, and 4; 10 (central) with 11, 12, 13, and 14; 5 (central) with 6, 7, 8, and 9; and 15 (central) with 16, 17, 18, and 19."
