**Pattern Identification**

To determine the pattern type in the graph, we follow these steps:

1. **Observation of Clusters and Groups**: The graph is divided into four distinct clusters or groups, each identified by a unique integer label.

2. **Cluster Analysis**:

   - **Left Cluster (13, 14, 10, 12, 11)**: This cluster forms a complete subgraph where every node is directly connected to every other node. Such a structure is characteristic of a 'clique' in graph theory.
   - **Top Cluster (6, 7, 9, 5, 8)**: Similar to the left cluster, all nodes are interconnected, indicating another instance of a clique.
   - **Right Cluster (0, 3, 4, 2, 1)**: Again, every node is connected to each other, making this a third clique.
   - **Bottom Cluster (16, 17, 15, 18, 19)**: This cluster also exhibits full connectivity among its nodes, thus representing a fourth clique.

3. **Counting Instances of Cliques**: Based on the analysis above, there are four distinct cliques in the graph.

4. **Conclusion and Analysis**: Given that all identified patterns are cliques and there are no chains or stars observed in the graph, the conclusion is that the graph consists entirely of cliques. The presence of four fully interconnected groups with no evidence of chain or star configurations supports this determination.
