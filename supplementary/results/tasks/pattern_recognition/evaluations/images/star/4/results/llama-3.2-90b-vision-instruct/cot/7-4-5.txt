**Pattern Identification**

To identify the pattern in the graph, we follow the steps outlined:

1. **Observe the Structure**: The graph consists of several disconnected groups of nodes. Each group has a central node connected to all other nodes within that group.

2. **Determine Interconnection**: There are no continuous sequences (chains) or fully interconnected clusters (cliques) without isolated nodes. Instead, each group features a central node connected to its peripherals, suggesting a 'star' pattern.

3. **Count Instances**: Upon closer inspection, there are four distinct groups, each with a clear central node and surrounding peripheral nodes.

**Conclusion**

Given the prevalence of central nodes with surrounding peripherals across four instances, the pattern type in the graph is predominantly a 'star.'

**Answer**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'The graph exhibits four distinct groups, each featuring a central node connected to all its surrounding peripheral nodes, fitting the definition of a "star" pattern.'
}
