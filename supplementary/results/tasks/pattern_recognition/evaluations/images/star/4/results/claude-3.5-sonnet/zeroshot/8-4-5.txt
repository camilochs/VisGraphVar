   "analysis": "The image contains 4 distinct star patterns, where each star has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. Specifically: (1) node 10 is connected to nodes 11,12,13,14; (2) node 0 is connected to nodes 1,2,3,4; (3) node 15 is connected to nodes 16,17,18,19; and (4) node 5 is connected to nodes 6,7,8,9. Each formation shows the characteristic hub-and-spoke arrangement typical of star patterns."
