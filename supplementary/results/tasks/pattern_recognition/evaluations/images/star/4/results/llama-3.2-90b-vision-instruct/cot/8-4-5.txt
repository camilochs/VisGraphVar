**Pattern Type Analysis**

After examining the graph image, we can identify the following patterns:

*   **Clique**: Three distinct cliques are present in the graph. A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent; that is, its induced subgraph is a complete graph.

**JSON Response**

```json

   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'We observe the presence of three distinct groups where every node within each group is connected to every other node within that group, thus forming cliques.'
}
