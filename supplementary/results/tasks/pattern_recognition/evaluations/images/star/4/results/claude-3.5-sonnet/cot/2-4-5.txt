   "analysis": "The graph shows 4 distinct star patterns. Each star pattern has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes: 1) Node 10 is central, connecting to nodes 11,12,13,14. 2) Node 0 is central, connecting to nodes 1,2,3,4. 3) Node 5 is central, connecting to nodes 6,7,8,9. 4) Node 15 is central, connecting to nodes 16,17,18,19. Each subgraph follows a star topology where one central node acts as a hub with radiating connections to surrounding nodes, and there are no direct connections between the peripheral nodes themselves."
