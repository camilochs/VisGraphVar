Based on the provided graph image, here's the identification of patterns:

```json
{
   'pattern': ["star"],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': "The graph contains four distinct patterns, each characterized as a 'star'. A 'star' pattern consists of one central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. Specifically:"
               "- Top-Left Cluster: Node 10 is the central node with connections to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14."
               "- Top-Right Cluster: Node 0 is the central node with connections to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4."
               "- Bottom-Left Cluster: Node 5 is the central node with connections to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9."
               "- Bottom-Right Cluster: Node 15 is the central node with connections to nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19."
}
