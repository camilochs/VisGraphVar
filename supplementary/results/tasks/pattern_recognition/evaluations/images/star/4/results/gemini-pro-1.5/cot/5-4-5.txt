Nodes 5-9: Node 5 is the central node connected to peripheral nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n3. Nodes 10-14: Node 10 is the central node connected to peripheral nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14.\n4. Nodes 15-19: Node 15 is the central node connected to peripheral nodes 16, 17, 18, and 19.\n\nEach star is a separate component, with no connections between the stars.  Each central node is connected to all other nodes within its star, and there are no interconnections between the peripheral nodes within the same star."
