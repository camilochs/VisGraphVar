**Analysis of the Graph**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we will follow the provided steps.

**Step 1: Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links.**

Upon examining the graph, it is evident that there are four distinct clusters or groups of nodes. Each cluster contains a set of interconnected nodes, with no connections between clusters.

**Step 2: Determine If Nodes Are Interconnected in a Continuous Sequence (for a 'chain'), Fully Interconnected Without Isolated Nodes (for a 'clique'), or If There Is a Central Node With Surrounding Peripheral Nodes (for a 'star').**

Within each cluster, nodes are fully interconnected without any isolated nodes. This characteristic aligns with the definition of a 'clique,' where every node is directly connected to every other node within the same group.

**Step 3: Count How Many Instances of Each Identified Pattern Appear in the Graph.**

Given that all observed groups exhibit the characteristics of a 'clique,' we count each cluster as an instance of this pattern type.

**Number of Patterns: 4**

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the identified pattern type in the graph is a 'clique,' with a total of 4 instances. The explanation for this conclusion lies in the detailed examination of the graph's layout, where each cluster demonstrates full interconnectivity among its nodes, fitting the definition of a 'clique.'

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 4,
   "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters, each of which displays full interconnectivity among its nodes, adhering to the definition of a clique. Thus, the pattern type identified is a clique, occurring four times within the graph."
