**Analysis of the Graph Image**

To identify the pattern in the given graph image, we will examine its structure and connections.

**Step 1: Identify the Graph Structure**

The graph consists of nodes (represented by numbers) connected by edges. The edges are undirected, meaning they do not have a specific direction.

**Step 2: Examine Node Connections**

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 0 (itself), forming a loop with node 0 and a separate connection with node 2. However, this description seems to be based on an assumed view of the image that isn't visible, so we'll correct the approach based on the typical understanding of such patterns.
- Given a standard interpretation without the image, let's proceed with the known patterns:
  - A "chain" pattern involves nodes connected in a linear sequence without any branches or loops.
  - A "clique" pattern is characterized by every node being directly connected to every other node.
  - A "star" pattern features a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, but those peripheral nodes are not interconnected.

**Conclusion**

Without the actual image to analyze, the description provided seems to be based on a misinterpretation or a non-standard description of graph patterns. However, typically:

- This kind of pattern, if showing a clear central point connected to several others directly without those others being fully interconnected, would suggest a star pattern.
- If all nodes are interconnected, it would indicate a clique.
- Linear sequences without branching or loops would indicate a chain.

Given the misunderstanding in the initial description and without the image, the correct approach is:
