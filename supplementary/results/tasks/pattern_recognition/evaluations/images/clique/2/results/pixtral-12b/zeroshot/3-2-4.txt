Based on a careful analysis of the graph image provided, here is the JSON formatted response:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": [2],
   "analysis": "The graph consists of two distinct star patterns. In each star pattern, there is a central node with edges connecting to multiple peripheral nodes, which is characteristic of a star graph."
}
```

Explanation:
- Two patterns match the "star" classification, where one node is highly connected to several other nodes, forming a central point with radiating connections.
- The first star pattern consists of nodes [7], [5], [6], and [4] with [7] being the central node.
- The second star pattern consists of nodes [0], [1], [2], and [3] with [0] being the central node.
- This classification reflects the structure seen in each sub-graph wherein all but one node are connected to the central node.
