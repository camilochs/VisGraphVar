To analyze the graph's pattern type, we observe that each cluster appears to be the same. Each has three nodes, including a central node with a direct edge from it to two peripheral nodes, indicating isolation from each other. Graphically, we can analyze this by grouping and making connections between nodes:

- **Node 1** has one direct edge to **node 2**.
- **Node 2** has one direct edge to **node 0**.
- There exists no direct edge connection between **node 1** and **node 0**, or any other **node** within a separate cluster.

**Conclusion:**

Following this reasoning, if we build a graph, we'll observe a **'star'** pattern type. It consists of one central node with two surrounding usability nodes with no information, connections, or use between **clusters**.
