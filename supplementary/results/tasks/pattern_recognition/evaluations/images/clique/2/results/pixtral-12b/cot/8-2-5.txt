Both clusters show nodes that are fully interconnected, which is characteristic of a clique. Each node within a cluster is connected to every other node in that same cluster.\nStep 3: Count the total number of clusters. There are two cliques in the graph.\nStep 4: From the above steps, it is clear that the dominant pattern is a clique in both clusters.'
