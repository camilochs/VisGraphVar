   "analysis": "The graph consists of two distinct clusters, each forming a star pattern.\n1. The first cluster on the left contains 5 nodes. These nodes are arranged such that one central node (node 5) is surrounded by 4 peripheral nodes (nodes 4, 6, 7). Each of the peripheral nodes is connected to the central node, forming a star pattern.\n2. The second cluster on the right contains 5 nodes. Similar to the first cluster, it consists of a central node (node 0) that is connected to 4 peripheral nodes (nodes 1, 2, 3). These peripheral nodes are also connected to the central node, creating another star pattern.\nThus, we identify 2 star patterns in the graph."
