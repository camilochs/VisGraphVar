Answer: 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1, 1],
   'analysis': 'The two distinct clusters in the graph indicate two separate pattern types. The first cluster (top left) consists of four interconnected nodes, forming a "clique." The second cluster (bottom right) features one central node with peripheral nodes, indicating a "star" pattern.'
}
```

Explanation:
   - The first cluster (top left) fulfills the criteria for a clique due to all nodes being interconnected.
   - The second cluster (bottom right) meets the requirements for a star pattern due to a central node with direct connections to other nodes.

Thus, the solution states that there is one occurrence of a clique and one occurrence of a star in the graph.
