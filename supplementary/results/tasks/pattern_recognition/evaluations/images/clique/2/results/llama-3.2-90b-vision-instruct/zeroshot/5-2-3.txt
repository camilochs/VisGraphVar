**Analysis of Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we will analyze its structure and connectivity.

**Step 1: Identifying Connectivity**

*   The graph consists of two separate subgraphs: one with vertices 0, 1, and 2, and another with vertices 3, 4, and 5.
*   In the first subgraph (0, 1, 2), vertex 0 is connected to both vertices 1 and 2, and there are no direct connections between vertices 1 and 2.
*   In the second subgraph (3, 4, 5), vertex 5 is connected to both vertices 3 and 4, with no direct connection between vertices 3 and 4.

**Step 2: Determining Pattern Type**

*   Given the connectivity, both subgraphs exhibit a structure where one central vertex (0 in the first subgraph and 5 in the second) is connected to two other vertices, but those two vertices are not connected to each other.
*   This structure aligns with the definition of a 'star' pattern in graph theory, where one central node connects to all other nodes, and these peripheral nodes do not connect among themselves.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph contains two instances of the 'star' pattern.

**Final Answer**

{
   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "Each pattern features a central vertex connected to multiple vertices that are not interconnected with each other."
