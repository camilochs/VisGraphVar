   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "To identify the pattern, we start by observing the structure of the graph. There are two distinct clusters in the image. 

   In the upper right cluster, there is a central node labeled 0, which is interconnected with three other nodes (1, 2, and 3). This forms a 'star' pattern because one node (0) connects with multiple peripheral nodes (1, 2, and 3).

   Similarly, in the lower left cluster, we have a central node labeled 5, which is interconnected with four other nodes (4, 6, and 7). This also forms a 'star' pattern because one node (5) connects with multiple peripheral nodes (4, 6, and 7).

   Therefore, there are two instances of the 'star' pattern in the graph image."
