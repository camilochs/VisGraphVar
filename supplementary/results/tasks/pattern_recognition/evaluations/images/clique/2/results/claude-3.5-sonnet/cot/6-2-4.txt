   "analysis": "The graph shows two separate groups of nodes, each forming a clique pattern. In each group, there are 4 nodes (0,1,2,3 in the first group and 4,5,6,7 in the second group) where every node is directly connected to every other node within its group. This creates a fully interconnected structure within each subgroup, which is the definition of a clique. Each node has three connections to the other nodes in its group, forming a complete subgraph. The presence of two separate but identical structures indicates there are 2 clique patterns in this graph."
