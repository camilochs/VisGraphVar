To determine the pattern types in the given graph image, let's follow the provided steps carefully:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.**
   - On the left side of the image, we have a central node labeled 7 to which four other nodes (4, 5, 6) are connected.
   - On the right side of the image, a central node labeled 0 is connected to four nodes (1, 2, 3) which form a cluster together.

2. **Determine the connectivity patterns:**
   - The left side of the graph can be seen as a 'star' pattern, where node 7 is central with nodes 4, 5, and 6 as peripheral nodes.
   - The right side of the graph can also be considered a 'star' pattern, where node 0 is central with nodes 1, 2, and 3 as peripheral nodes.

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:**
   - There are two instances of the 'star' pattern in total (one on each side).

4. **Explain the reasoning:**
   - Both sides of the graph exhibit a central node with peripheral nodes linking directly to it, forming multiple star patterns.

In summary:
```json
{
   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "The left side of the graph has a central node 7 with periphery nodes 4, 5, 6 forming a star pattern. Similarly, the right side of the graph has a central node 0 with periphery nodes 1, 2, 3 also forming a star. Thus, there are two instances of star patterns observed in the graph."
