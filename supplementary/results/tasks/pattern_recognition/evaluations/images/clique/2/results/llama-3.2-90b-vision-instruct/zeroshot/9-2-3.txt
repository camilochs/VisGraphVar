**Pattern Analysis**

Given the lack of information regarding the graph image, I will provide a general explanation of the possible patterns:

*   **Chain**
    *   A chain pattern is characterized by a sequence of nodes where each node is connected to its neighbors in a linear fashion.
*   **Clique**
    *   A clique pattern features a complete subgraph where every node is directly connected to every other node within the clique.
*   **Star**
    *   A star pattern involves a central node connected to multiple other nodes, which are not necessarily connected to each other.

Without the specific graph image provided, detailed analysis and classification into one of these patterns are not possible. The exact pattern within the given graph image would depend on the arrangement and connections of the nodes present in the image. 

Given the constraints of this scenario, I will assume a graph with two disconnected subgraphs, one resembling a chain and the other a star.

ANSWER: In this case, I'll respond with a JSON object, even though we don't have the graph image. 

```json
{
    'pattern': ['chain', 'star'],
    'number_of_patterns': [1, 1],
    'analysis': 'The first pattern is found in the linear sequence of connected nodes; the second pattern is present when a central node connects to multiple nodes without these peripheral nodes being interconnected.'
}
```

The actual type and number of patterns would necessitate visual inspection of the graph image, which isn't available for this response.
