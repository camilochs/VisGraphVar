**Analysis of the Graph Image**

After analyzing the graph image, I have identified the type of pattern it contains.

**Pattern Identification**

*   **Pattern Type:** The graph image contains a 'clique' pattern.
*   **Number of Patterns:** There are 2 instances of this pattern in the graph.
*   **Analysis:** A clique is a subgraph where every node is connected to every other node. In this graph, we can see two distinct groups of nodes that are fully connected within themselves. The first group consists of nodes 0, 1, and 2, while the second group comprises nodes 3, 4, and 5. Each node within these groups has an edge connecting it to every other node in the same group, fulfilling the definition of a clique.

**Conclusion**

The graph image exhibits a 'clique' pattern with two instances.
