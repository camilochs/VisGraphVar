**Pattern Analysis: Chain**

* **Pattern:** The graph features a chain pattern.
* **Number of Patterns:** A total of 3 chain patterns are present in the graph.

The chain pattern is distinguished by sequential connections between nodes and the absence of branching or loops. In this graph, three distinct chains can be identified.

* **Chain 1:** Connecting nodes 0, 2, and 1.
* **Chain 2:** Connecting nodes 4, 5, and 6.
* **Chain 3:** Connecting nodes 0, 2, 3, and 0 (excluding the loop).

The remaining nodes (3 and 7) exhibit characteristics of a star pattern but do not form a complete chain. Therefore, the primary pattern in the graph is a chain.
