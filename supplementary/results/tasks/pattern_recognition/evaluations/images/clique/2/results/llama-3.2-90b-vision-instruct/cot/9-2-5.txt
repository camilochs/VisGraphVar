To identify the pattern type in the graph image, we can follow these steps:

1. Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:
   The graph appears to have two main clusters or subgraphs that are not directly connected to each other.

2. Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star'):
   Upon closer inspection, both subgraphs show characteristics of a clique where every node is connected to every other node within its respective group. There's no visible chain or star pattern that fits the classical definitions.

3. Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:
   Since we've identified two groups that exhibit clique-like behavior, the count for this pattern would be 2.

Given the above analysis, the response in JSON format would look like this:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains two distinct subgraphs where each node is connected to every other node within its group, fitting the definition of a clique. This layout indicates that the pattern type is a clique, and there are two instances of it in the graph.'
}
```

This detailed response should accurately capture the identified pattern and explain the reasoning behind it based on the observed layout and node relationships in the provided graph image.
