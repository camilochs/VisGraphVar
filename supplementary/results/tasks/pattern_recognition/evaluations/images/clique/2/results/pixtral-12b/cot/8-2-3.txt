In the first cluster on the left, nodes 1, 2, and 0 are connected to each other. Similarly, in the second cluster on the right, nodes 4, 3, and 5 are interconnected. Given this structure where each node in a cluster is connected to every other node in the same cluster, we identify these clusters as cliques."
