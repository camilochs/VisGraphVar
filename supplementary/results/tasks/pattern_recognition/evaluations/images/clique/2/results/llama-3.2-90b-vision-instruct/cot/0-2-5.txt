**Step 1: Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.**

The graph consists of two separate clusters of nodes with lines connecting them to form triangles.

**Step 2: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').**

The nodes on the left side of the image are interconnected in a single triangular structure, while the nodes on the right side are interconnected in a single triangular structure.

**Step 3: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.**

There are two instances of the triangular structure in the graph.

**Step 4: Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes.**

The graph is divided into two distinct triangular structures, each with three nodes interconnected by lines. There is no continuous sequence of nodes (chain), no fully interconnected nodes without isolated nodes (clique), and no central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (star).

**Final Answer:**
