Based on the provided image, I observe two distinct clusters of nodes. One cluster consists of nodes 8, 5, 9, 6, and 7, while the other cluster comprises nodes 2, 3, 4, 1, and 0.

Upon closer inspection, I notice that within each cluster, every node is connected to every other node. This characteristic is indicative of a 'clique' pattern, where all nodes are fully interconnected without any isolated nodes.

I do not observe a continuous sequence of nodes (for a 'chain') or a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star') in the image.

Therefore, I conclude that the identified pattern type is 'clique,' and there are two instances of this pattern in the image.

My analysis is based on the layout and relationships among the nodes, where each cluster exhibits full interconnectivity among its constituent nodes, thus fulfilling the criteria for a 'clique' pattern.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "Two clusters are observed, each exhibiting full interconnectivity among its nodes, thereby identifying the pattern as a 'clique.'"
}
