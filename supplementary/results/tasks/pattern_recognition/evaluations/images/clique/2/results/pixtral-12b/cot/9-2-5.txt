   'analysis': 'In the graph image, two distinct patterns are visible. 

   Step 1: Structure observation 
   - The first cluster on the bottom left consists of a central node (node 2) connecting to four other nodes (nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4). 
   - The second cluster on the top right includes a central node (node 5) connecting to five other nodes (nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9).

   Step 2: Pattern identification
   - Both clusters exhibit a central node that is connected to peripheral nodes, indicating a "star" pattern. 

   Step 3: Counting patterns
   - There are exactly 2 instances of the "star" pattern in the image.

   Step 4: Explanation of reason
   - A "star" pattern is determined by the clear central point with symmetrical connections to other points, which is evident in both clusters in the graph. The central node is linked to the surrounding nodes, making it characteristic of a star.'
