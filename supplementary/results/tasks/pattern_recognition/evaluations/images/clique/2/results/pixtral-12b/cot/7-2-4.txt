   "analysis": "1. The graph consists of two distinct clusters of interconnected nodes, one at the bottom left and one at the top right. 
2. Each cluster has a central node with peripheral nodes connected to it, which embodies the 'star' pattern.
3. The bottom left cluster has node '1' as the central node connected to nodes '0', '2', and '3'.
4. The top right cluster has node '5' as the central node connected to nodes '4', '6', and '7'.
5. Because both clusters follow the 'star' pattern, which comprises a central node with multiple peripheral nodes, it is clear that there are two instances of the 'star' pattern in the graph."
