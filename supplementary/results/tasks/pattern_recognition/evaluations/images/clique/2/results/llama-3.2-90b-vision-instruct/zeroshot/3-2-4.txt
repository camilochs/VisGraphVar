**Step 1: Identify the pattern type**

The graph contains two distinct patterns. The first pattern is a chain, which is a sequence of nodes connected by edges. The second pattern is a star, where one node is connected to multiple other nodes.

**Step 2: Count the number of patterns**

There are two chains and one star in the graph.

**Conclusion**

```json
{
  'pattern': ['chain', 'star'],
  'number_of_patterns': 2,
  'analysis': 'A chain is identified by consecutive nodes following the edges between them throughout the graph, while a star pattern centers one node that connects to multiple other nodes without connecting each of these to others in its space.'
}
```

In this case, the graph can have both chain and star patterns, but these patterns could be made clearer by redrawing the star pattern to be properly condensed with its center node.
