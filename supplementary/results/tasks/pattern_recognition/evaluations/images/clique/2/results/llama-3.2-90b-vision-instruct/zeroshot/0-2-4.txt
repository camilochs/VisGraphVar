**Pattern Analysis**

Given the graph image, we observe its structural layout to identify any discernible patterns.

### Pattern Identification

The provided graph includes two distinct subgraphs. Each subgraph consists of connected nodes and edges, primarily consisting of sets of three nodes connected to a central node.

### Pattern Type

Based on the observed structure, we can identify the presence of **clique** patterns within the graph. A clique is characterized by every node being connected to every other node within the group, forming a complete subgraph.

### Count and Analysis

There are two distinct clique patterns in the graph. The first clique involves nodes 0, 1, and 2, while the second clique comprises nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7. These groups are identifiable by their dense interconnections between members.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "Both cliques exhibit interconnection among all nodes, constituting complete subgraphs."
