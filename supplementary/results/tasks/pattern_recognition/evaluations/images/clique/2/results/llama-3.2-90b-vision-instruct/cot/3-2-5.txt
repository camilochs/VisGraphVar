Since the problem statement does not include a graph image, I will provide a general analysis based on the given pattern types without specific reference to any image. However, note that typically, this kind of analysis would be conducted after visual inspection of an actual graph. In such a case, the analysis would follow these steps:

1. Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.
2. Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').
3. Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.

Given that we cannot perform the first step due to the absence of a graph image, the following response provides a placeholder for what the format of the answer would look like, assuming hypothetical examples for pattern identification:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['chain', 'clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2, 1, 3],
   'analysis': 'Upon examining the structure, we identified a sequence of nodes interconnected linearly, suggesting the presence of chains. There's also a fully interconnected set of nodes without any isolated points, indicating a clique. Moreover, several configurations feature central nodes connected to multiple peripheral nodes, resembling star patterns. By counting these instances, we found two chain patterns, one clique pattern, and three star patterns across the graph.'
}
```

This response format illustrates how one would analyze a graph by identifying different pattern types, counting their instances, and explaining the reasoning behind the observed structures, assuming the existence and examination of a graph image.
