Given such task, but no image provided, I am unable to fulfill the task. Here is an example using an imaginary star-type pattern:

```json
{
    'pattern':  ['star'],
    'number_of_patterns':  [2],
    'analysis': ' In two areas on the graph, several nodes are arranged in a star pattern with shorter lines connecting to a central node without any isolated sections. The graph contains no sign of a continuous link like a chain or a clique. Using these observations, such pattern can be identified'
}
```
