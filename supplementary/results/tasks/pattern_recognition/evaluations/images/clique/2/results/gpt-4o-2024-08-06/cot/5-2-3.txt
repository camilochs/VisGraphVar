   "analysis": "The graph consists of two distinct groups of interconnected nodes. Each group forms a triangle, meaning every node within the group is directly connected to every other node. The first group includes nodes 0, 1, and 2, and the second group includes nodes 3, 4, and 5. There are no isolated nodes or unconnected combinations. Hence, there are two 'clique' patterns in this graph."
