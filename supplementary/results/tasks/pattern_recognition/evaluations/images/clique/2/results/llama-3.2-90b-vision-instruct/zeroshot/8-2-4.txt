**Pattern Recognition Analysis**

**Pattern Recognition Result**

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 1,
   'analysis': 'The central node has multiple edges connected to various other nodes, a characteristic typical of a star pattern in graph theory. There are no chains or cliques, confirming a single, distinct star pattern in the graph. Hence, only one star pattern is identified in the image provided.'
}
```

**Relevant Elements:**

* Central node with multiple edges
* Connection to various other nodes

**Explanation and Calculation:**

The graph image shows a central node with multiple edges connected to other nodes. This is a characteristic feature of a star pattern in graph theory. There are no chains or cliques visible in the image, confirming that this is a single, distinct star pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the pattern recognized in the image is a 'star' pattern, with only one such pattern present in the image.
