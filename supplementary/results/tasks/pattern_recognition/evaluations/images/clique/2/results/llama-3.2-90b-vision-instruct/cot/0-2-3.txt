Based on the analysis of the image, here is the identified pattern type in JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'The image shows a graph with multiple nodes and edges, where each node has a connection to only one other node. This pattern is characteristic of a star graph, where a central node (the center of the star) is connected to multiple peripheral nodes. Since there are 4 such central nodes in the image, the number of patterns is 4.'
}
```

In summary, the pattern type identified in the image is a star graph, with 4 instances of this pattern appearing in the graph. The central nodes in each star are connected to multiple peripheral nodes, resulting in a total of 4 star patterns in the image.
