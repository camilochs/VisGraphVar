  "analysis": "The graph consists of two distinct clusters of nodes. Within each cluster, every node is connected to every other node, forming a fully connected subgraph. This characteristic defines a 'clique' pattern. Thus, there are two 'clique' patterns present in the graph; one clique formed by nodes 0, 1 and 2, and another clique formed by nodes 3, 4 and 5."
