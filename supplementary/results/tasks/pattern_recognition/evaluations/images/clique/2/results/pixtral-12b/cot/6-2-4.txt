      "The graph consists of two distinct clusters of interconnected nodes, each forming a fully connected subgraph without isolated nodes. 

      Step-by-Step Analysis:

      1. First cluster (top right): Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 are placed such that there is an edge between every pair of nodes. This indicates a 'clique' where all nodes are fully connected.
      2. Second cluster (bottom left): Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 are also fully interconnected, as each node has a direct edge to every other node in this cluster, again forming a 'clique.'

      Conclusion:
      - Each node in both clusters is connected to every other node within the same cluster. No node is isolated. Thus, we identified 2 instances of fully interconnected subgraphs, known as 'cliques.'"
