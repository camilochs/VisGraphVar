Let's analyze the graph image step-by-step:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**
   - There are two distinct groups of nodes visible in the image.
   - Each group of nodes is fully interconnected within the group.

2. **Determine the type of pattern based on how the nodes are interconnected:**
   - For both groups of nodes, every node is connected to every other node within that group. This indicates that there are no missing connections between the nodes within each group.
   - This type of full interconnectivity is characteristic of a 'clique.'

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:**
   - There are two clusters, each of which is a fully interconnected group (clique).

4. **Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes:**
   - Each cluster of nodes is connected to every other node within that group, forming a complete graph for each cluster.
   - The lack of any nodes or connections extending between the two clusters means that each group operates independently from the others.

Here is the reasoning and analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "Upon analyzing the graph, two distinct clusters were identified. Each cluster of nodes is fully interconnected with no missing links between the nodes within the cluster, which defines a 'clique.' In other words, each node within a cluster is connected to every other node in the same cluster. Consequently, both clusters exhibit clique behavior."
