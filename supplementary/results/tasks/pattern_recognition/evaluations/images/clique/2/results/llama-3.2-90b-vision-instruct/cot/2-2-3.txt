**Solution Approach:**
To determine the pattern in the given graph, we will analyze nodes and their connections to identify common patterns such as 'chain,' 'clique,' or 'star.' This analysis involves identifying isolated groups or specific node relationships that fit these patterns.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

### Identification of Clusters

*   **Cluster 1 (Nodes 0, 1, 2):** Nodes 1 and 2 are directly connected to Node 0, forming a 'star' pattern since one central node (0) connects to peripheral nodes (1 and 2) directly.
*   **Cluster 2 (Nodes 3, 4, 5):** This cluster shows a connection from Node 3 to Node 4 and from Nodes 4 to Node 5, representing a 'chain' where each node is connected to the next in a sequence (3->4->5).

### Pattern Identification

*   **Chain Pattern:** Identified in Cluster 2 with nodes 3, 4, 5 forming a linear connection.
*   **Star Pattern:** Observed in Cluster 1 with Node 0 as the central node connecting to peripheral nodes 1 and 2.

### Final Analysis

Given the distinct patterns identified in separate clusters of the graph:

*   **Number of Patterns:** 2 ('chain' and 'star').
*   **Conclusion:** The graph exhibits both a 'chain' and a 'star' pattern, each confined to separate clusters without overlap.

**Conclusion:**

```json
{
    "pattern": ["chain", "star"],
    "number_of_patterns": 2,
    "analysis": "The graph contains a 'chain' pattern among nodes 3, 4, and 5, and a 'star' pattern around node 0 with connected nodes 1 and 2."
