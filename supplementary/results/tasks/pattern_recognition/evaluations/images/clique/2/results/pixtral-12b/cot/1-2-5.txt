From analyzing the given image, the pattern is identified as follows:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2],
   'analysis': 'Step-by-step analysis:\n1. Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.\n   Each cluster in the image consists of a central node connected to several peripheral nodes.\n2. Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').\n   The graph exhibits a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes which characterizes a 'star' pattern.\n3. Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.\n   There are two distinct clusters in the graph, both resembling the 'star' pattern.\n4. Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes.\n   Both clusters have a central node (node 1 in the top cluster and node 5 in the bottom cluster) with surrounding peripheral nodes, typical of a 'star' graph.'
}
```

Explanation:
1. Observing the structure, each cluster in the image consists of a central node connected to several peripheral nodes.
2. The nodes are not in a continuous sequence (chain) nor fully interconnected without isolated nodes (clique), but rather have a primary central node with surrounding peripheral nodes.
3. Counting the clusters, we observe two distinct instances.
4. The layout and relationships among nodes match the 'star' pattern, indicating a central node with multiple peripheral nodes connected to it.
