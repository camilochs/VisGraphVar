**Step 1: Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.**

There are two main clusters in the image that resemble cliques.

**Step 2: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').**

Each cluster shows full interconnection of nodes without any isolated nodes forming a complete graph structure known as a clique.

**Step 3: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.**

Since both clusters display the characteristics of a clique and there are two such groups, there are two instances of the clique pattern.

**Conclusion:**

```json
{
  'pattern': 'clique',
  'number_of_patterns': 2,
  'analysis': 'Two fully interconnected sets of nodes are present, resembling k-cliques where every node is connected to every other node.'
}
