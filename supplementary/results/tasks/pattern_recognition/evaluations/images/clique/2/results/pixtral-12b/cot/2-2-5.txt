   "analysis": "1. First, observe the two distinct clusters of interconnected nodes in the graph image.\n2. Each cluster has nodes that are fully connected to each other without any isolated nodes, indicating the presence of cliques.\n3. The first cluster consists of nodes 6, 5, 7, 8, and 9, all of which are interconnected.\n4. The second cluster consists of nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, also fully interconnected.\n5. Since both clusters exhibit characteristics of cliques — every node within these clusters is connected to every other node — we conclude that the identified pattern is cliques."
