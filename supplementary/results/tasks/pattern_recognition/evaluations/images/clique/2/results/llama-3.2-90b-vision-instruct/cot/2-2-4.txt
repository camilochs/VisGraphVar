analyzing the image produces the following result:

```json
{
   'pattern': [
   'chain',
   'star'
   ],
   'number_of_patterns': [1,1],
   'analysis': 'The image presents two distinct patterns. The upper-right section of the image appears to be a 'chain,' with a series of nodes sequenced in order.  Similarly, the lower-left section of the image forms a 'star' with surrounding nodes linked via a central node. Based on the layout and connections, isolated nodes, and the relationship of the nodes, the identified patterns appear to be a 'chain' and a 'star'.'
}
