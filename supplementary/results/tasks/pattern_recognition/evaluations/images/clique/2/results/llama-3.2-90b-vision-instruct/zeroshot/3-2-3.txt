**Pattern Identification in the Graph Image**

To identify the pattern in the graph image, we need to examine its structure and connectivity.

**Step 1: Examine Individual Components**

- **Component around Node 0**: This node is connected to nodes 1 and 2, forming a small subgraph. It does not fully connect all its nodes (e.g., no direct connection between nodes 1 and 2), making it not a clique. Given its topology, with a central node (0) connecting to multiple others without interconnections among those others, it resembles a star pattern.
  
- **Component around Node 3**: This node is connected to nodes 4 and 5. Similar to the component around node 0, it does not form a clique due to the lack of direct connections between nodes 4 and 5. It also resembles a star pattern with node 3 at the center.

**Step 2: Determine the Overall Pattern Type**

Given that both components resemble star patterns and there's no evidence of a chain or a clique when considering the whole graph, the identified pattern aligns with 'star.'

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the graph exhibits a 'star' pattern, with two instances where a central node connects to others without those others being interconnected, fitting the criteria for this pattern type.

**Answer:**

```json
{
  'pattern': ['star'],
  'number_of_patterns': 2,
  'analysis': 'The presence of two components, each with a central node directly connected to multiple nodes without interconnections among them, characterizes the star pattern.'
}
```
