**Analysis of the Graph Image**

Based on the provided graph image, I have identified a specific pattern and analyzed its characteristics. The results are presented in the following format:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'The image contains two separate graphs, where each one shows one node connected to two other nodes.'
}
```

**Key Findings:**

* **Pattern Identification:** Upon examining the graph image, I observed that it consists of two distinct graphs, each resembling a 'star' pattern.
* **Number of Patterns:** There are two instances of the 'star' pattern present in the image.
* **Analysis and Justification:**
	+ Each graph has one central node connected to two other nodes.
	+ This characteristic is consistent with the definition of a 'star' pattern, where a central node is connected to multiple peripheral nodes, and these peripheral nodes are not directly connected to each other.

In conclusion, the graph image exhibits a clear 'star' pattern in two separate instances, as evidenced by the central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes in each graph.
