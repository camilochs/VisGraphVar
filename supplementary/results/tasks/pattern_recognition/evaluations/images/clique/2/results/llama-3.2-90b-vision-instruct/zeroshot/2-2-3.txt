I'm sorry, but I cannot access or view the given image description. However, based on the common descriptions of the types of patterns you provided, here is a general analysis that can be used in the absence of the image.

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': '1',
   'analysis': 'The pattern contains one central node that is connected to 4 other nodes. None of the outer nodes have connections to each other.'
}
```

This response assumes a 'star' pattern where the central node branches out to other nodes that do not have connections with each other, but based on your actual image, the analysis could differ.
