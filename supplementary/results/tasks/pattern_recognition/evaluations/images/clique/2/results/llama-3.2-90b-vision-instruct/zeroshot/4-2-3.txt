**Graph Pattern Analysis**

Based on the provided graph image, the following analysis and conclusion can be drawn:

**Analysis:**

*   The graph consists of two disconnected components, each with its own structure.
*   Let's focus on the first component: it involves nodes directly connected to a central node, forming a distinct arrangement.

**Conclusion:**

The pattern identified in the graph is a **star**.

```json
{
   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": [1],
   "analysis": "The graph contains a single star pattern with multiple nodes connected to a central node, resembling a star-like structure."
}
