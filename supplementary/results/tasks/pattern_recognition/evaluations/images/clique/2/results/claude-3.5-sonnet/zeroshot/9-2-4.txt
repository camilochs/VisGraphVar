   "analysis": "The graph contains two separate clique patterns. Each clique consists of 4 nodes where every node is connected to every other node in the group. The first clique involves nodes 0,1,2,3 and the second clique involves nodes 4,5,6,7. Each forms a complete subgraph where all vertices are connected to each other."
