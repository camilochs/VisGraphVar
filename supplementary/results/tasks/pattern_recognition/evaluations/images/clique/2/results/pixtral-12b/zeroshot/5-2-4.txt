Here is the analysis in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['cliques'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2],
   'analysis': "The graph consists of two distinct subgraphs, each forming a clique. A clique in a graph is a subset of nodes such that every pair of nodes in the subset is connected by an edge. Both subgraphs in the image satisfy this condition, making them cliques. One subgraph includes nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, while the other includes nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7."
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph contains two distinct subgraphs.
- Each subgraph forms a complete graph or clique, where every pair of nodes in each subset is fully connected.
- The first clique includes nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- The second clique includes nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- There are no chains or star patterns observed in this graph.
