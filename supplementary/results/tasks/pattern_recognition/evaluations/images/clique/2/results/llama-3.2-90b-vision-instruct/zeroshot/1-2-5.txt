To analyze the graph image, it is important to define the characteristics of each potential pattern type.

*   Chain: A sequence of connected nodes where each node connects to only one other node on its left and right. The end of the chain might be detected by an unconnected relationship to its left or right.
*   Clique: A group of fully connected nodes. This means every node in this clique has a connection to every other node. All nodes must have the same number of relationships.
*   Star: A central node connected to every peripheral node, with no direct connections to each other in the periphery.

Examining the graph image, two distinct groups of interconnected nodes are visible. One is characterized as seven nodes with six interconnections, with four central nodes interconnecting to all other nodes. The remaining three nodes interconnect to exactly three of the central nodes. This group, therefore, corresponds to the clique pattern.

The second group is formed of three nodes with two interconnections showing one of the nodes is more connected to the remaining two nodes with direct relationships. However, the number of interconnects being consistent is only shared between the two most connected nodes rather than being consistent across all nodes. Despite this, it exhibits similar characteristics to a clique because all nodes share the same number of relationships, conforming to the definition of a clique. This also matches a clique.

In conclusion, based on the definitions, the graph image contains two patterns that correspond to the clique definition.
