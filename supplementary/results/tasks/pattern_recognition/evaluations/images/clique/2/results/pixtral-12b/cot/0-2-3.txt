   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'Based on the graph structure: 

   1. The first grouping consists of a central node (0) with three surrounding nodes (1, 2). This arrangement forms a star pattern, where one central node connects directly to three other nodes.
   
   2. The second grouping consists of a central node (4) with two surrounding nodes (3, 5). This setup also forms a star pattern, with one central node connecting directly to two other nodes.

   Therefore, the graph contains two instances of star patterns.'
