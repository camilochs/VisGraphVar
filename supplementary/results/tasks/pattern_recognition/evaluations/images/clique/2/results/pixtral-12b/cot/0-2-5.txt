   'analysis': 'The graph image shows two distinct structures, both of which have a central node connected to several peripheral nodes. Each central node (3 and 8) is linked to all the surrounding nodes (1, 4, 2, 9, 5, 6, and 7). This indicates that the pattern present in the graph is a star pattern with two instances. Each central node acts as the main connecting point for the peripheral nodes, forming clusters or subgraphs centered around a primary node.'
