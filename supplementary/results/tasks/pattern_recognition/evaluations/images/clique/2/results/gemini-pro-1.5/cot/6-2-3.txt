  "analysis": "The graph consists of two distinct sets of interconnected nodes. In the first set, nodes 0, 1, and 2 are fully connected to each other, forming a clique. Separately, nodes 3, 4, and 5 are also fully connected, forming another clique. There are no connections between these two clusters. Therefore, the identified pattern is 'clique' and there are two such patterns in the graph."
