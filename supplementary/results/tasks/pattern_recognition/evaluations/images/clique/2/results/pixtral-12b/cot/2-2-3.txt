                2. Each cluster consists of one central node connected to two other peripheral nodes.
                3. There are no additional connections between clusters or within clusters apart from the nodes directly linked to the central nodes.
                4. The clusters' organized structure around a single central node makes them identifiable as 'star' patterns.
                5. There are no sequences or fully interconnected nodes, which would indicate a 'chain' or 'clique' pattern respectively."
