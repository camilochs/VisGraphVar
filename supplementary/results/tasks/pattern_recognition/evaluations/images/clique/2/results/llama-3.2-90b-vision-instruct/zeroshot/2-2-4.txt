### Step 1: Identify the properties of each pattern type

*   A chain pattern depicts vertices linked in a continuous chain
*   A clique pattern is characterized by vertices that are each fully connected to every other vertex
*   A star pattern consists of a central node connected to all other nodes with no connections between those nodes

### Step 2: Identify Vertices, with Their Corresponding Connections, in the Image Supplied.

*   Vertices 0 and 1 are connected to vertex 3 (top)
*   Vertices 4, 5, 6, and 7 are all connected to each other and no other vertices (bottom).

### Step 3: Investigate the Observed Properties of Each Pattern Type By Iterating Through Observed Vertices and Their Connections

*   Vertices 0, 1, and 2 form a chain
*   Vertices 4, 5, 6, and 7 form a clique
*   Vertices 0, 1, and 2, and their connection to vertex 3, and vertices 4, 5, 6, and 7 can all be characterized as forming a clique with a chain linked to the clique.

**This evidence collectively describes a clique of two chain-like sets.**



### Final Steps: Create JSON Panel with Findings

```json

{

   "pattern": ["clique", "chain"],

   "number_of_patterns": 2,

   "analysis": "One clique and one chain exist in the graph observed."

}
