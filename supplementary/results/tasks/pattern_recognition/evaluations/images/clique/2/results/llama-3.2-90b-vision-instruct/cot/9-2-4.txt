To determine the pattern type in the graph image, let's follow the steps outlined:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links**: The graph consists of two separate clusters. One cluster has nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 interconnected in a circular fashion, with each node directly connected to every other node. The second cluster includes nodes labeled 4, 5, 6, and 7 also interconnected, forming a similar circular pattern without any single central node connected directly to all others in a star configuration.

2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star')**: Both clusters in the graph exhibit full interconnection among their respective nodes, indicating that they each form a clique. A clique is characterized by all its nodes being directly connected to each other, which is observed here.

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph**: Given the description above, there are two instances of the clique pattern within the graph.

4. **Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes**: The reasoning is based on the definition of a clique, where every node is connected to every other node. In the graph, each cluster behaves as one would expect of a clique: every node within a cluster is directly linked to every other node within that same cluster. This fulfills the criteria for identifying a clique.

**Answer**:

```json
{
   "pattern": "clique",
   "number_of_patterns": 2,
   "analysis": "The graph shows two clusters where all nodes within each cluster are directly connected to one another, fitting the definition of a clique. Each cluster represents one instance of this pattern."
}
