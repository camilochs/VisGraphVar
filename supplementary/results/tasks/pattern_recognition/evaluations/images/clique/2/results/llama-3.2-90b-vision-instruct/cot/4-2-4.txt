**Pattern Analysis**

To identify the pattern type in the given graph image, we will follow the specified steps:

**Step 1: Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**

*   The graph consists of two disconnected components.
*   The first component is located in the top-left corner, and the second component is positioned at the bottom-right corner.

**Step 2: Determine the Interconnectedness of Nodes**

*   In the first component:
    *   Node 6 is connected to node 7.
    *   Node 7 is connected to node 4 and node 5.
    *   Node 4 is directly connected to nodes 6 and 7 but not directly to node 5.
    *   Node 5 is directly connected to node 7 but not directly to nodes 4 or 6.
*   In the second component:
    *   Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
    *   Node 2 is connected to node 1 only.
    *   Node 3 has no direct connections other than with node 0.
    *   Node 1 is connected to node 2 only.

**Step 3: Count Instances of Each Identified Pattern**

*   Both components exhibit a "clique" pattern, where every node is connected to every other node within its respective group, except for the node isolated in the center-right part of the second cluster.
*   However, upon closer inspection, in both components, not all nodes are directly connected to each other. This breaks the definition of a "clique," which requires all nodes to be directly connected.
*   Each component can be considered as having a central node (node 7 in the first component and node 0 in the second component) with surrounding nodes. This structure aligns more closely with the definition of a "star" pattern, where a central node connects to all other nodes, and those other nodes do not necessarily connect to each other.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the identified pattern type is a "star" because:

*   In both components, there is a central node (node 7 and node 0, respectively) that connects to all other nodes within its component.
*   The other nodes within each component are not necessarily interconnected among themselves, which aligns with the definition of a "star" pattern.

**Final Answer:**

In JSON format:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["star"],
   "number_of_patterns": [2],
   "analysis": "The graph consists of two disconnected star patterns. Each star has a central node connected to peripheral nodes that do not interconnect among themselves, fitting the definition of a star pattern."
