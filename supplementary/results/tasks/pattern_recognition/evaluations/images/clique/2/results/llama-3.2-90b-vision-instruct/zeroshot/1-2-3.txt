I'm sorry but a correct response is not possible without the relevant information, which in this case is a graph image. However, I will respond assuming a hypothetical scenario. 

Assuming a graph image was provided with the nodes labeled as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
 The edges between the nodes are as follows: 0 is connected to 1 and 2, 3 is connected to 4 and 5. The nodes 1 and 2 are not interconnected. We can now assign it. 


```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'Two separate sets of connected nodes are observed, including nodes 0, 1, and 2, and nodes 3, 4, and 5. Each set represents a fully connected subgraph, making them cliques.'
}
```
