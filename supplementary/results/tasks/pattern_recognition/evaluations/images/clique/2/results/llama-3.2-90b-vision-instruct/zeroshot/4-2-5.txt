**Pattern Analysis**

The graph image will be analyzed to identify the type of pattern it contains. The possible patterns are 'chain', 'clique', or 'star'. 

Based on the image, node 1 is linked to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4, forming a pattern. Node 5 is linked to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9, creating another pattern. 

Since the nodes at each end of the patterns have more than two connections to their neighbors, they do not form a chain. Due to these nodes each having more than three connections to other nodes, they do not form a clique. These criteria fit the star pattern.

**Pattern Recognition Output**
