**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the graph, we will examine its structure and connectivity.

**Pattern Type**

*   The graph is composed of two distinct groups of nodes: one chain-like structure (left) and one clique-like structure (right).
*   In the chain-like part, vertices 5, 6, 8, and 9 are connected in a linear sequence, but vertex 5 is also connected to vertex 7 and 9, indicating additional connections that are not strictly linear. This connection to vertices 7 and 9 makes it more than a simple chain, but it does not have every vertex connected to every other vertex, nor does it radiate from a central vertex like a star.
*   In the clique-like part, vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 have mutual connections among them, forming a complete subgraph where all vertices are directly connected to each other. This meets the criteria for a clique pattern, however, it is important to note there's also an indication of a star-like connectivity with vertex 2 potentially serving as a central node.

**Conclusion**

Considering these observations, both a clique pattern and a star pattern could be argued based on the vertices connections. However, the star pattern seems less pronounced given the connectivity is not strictly radiating from a single central vertex in an obvious manner across the entire graph.
