   "analysis": "The graph is divided into two distinct clusters, each forming a cross-like structure. Each cluster contains four nodes (0, 1, 2, 3 in one cluster and 4, 5, 6, 7 in the other), where each node is directly connected to every other node within its cluster. This pattern is characteristic of a 'clique', where every node is fully interconnected without any isolated nodes. Therefore, both clusters are identified as cliques."
