Unfortunately, the provided image description does not contain an image to analyze. However, I can provide a general framework for analyzing a graph image based on the given steps.

**Analysis Framework**

To analyze the graph image, follow these steps:

1.  **Observe the Structure**: Identify distinct clusters, groups, or links in the graph.
2.  **Determine Node Interconnections**: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').
3.  **Count Instances**: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.

**Example JSON Response**

Assuming the analysis of a graph image with two distinct patterns:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["chain", "star"],
   "number_of_patterns": [1, 1],
   "analysis": "The graph image contains one chain pattern and one star pattern. The chain pattern consists of three interconnected nodes, while the star pattern features a central node connected to three peripheral nodes."
}
```

This response indicates the presence of both 'chain' and 'star' patterns in the graph image, with one instance of each pattern. The analysis explains the structure and node interconnections for each pattern, providing a clear understanding of the graph's layout.
