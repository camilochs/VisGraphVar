**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the graph image, we follow these steps:

1. **Observe the Structure**: The graph consists of two disconnected clusters, each with its own set of vertices and edges.

2. **Identify Distinct Clusters or Groups**: There are two distinct clusters. One cluster contains vertices labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3, interconnected by edges. The other cluster includes vertices labeled 4, 5, 6, and 7, also interconnected.

3. **Determine Interconnectedness**: Within each cluster, all nodes are interconnected with each other, forming a clique-like structure. However, there are no direct connections between the nodes of the two clusters.

4. **Count Instances of Each Pattern**: Both clusters exhibit a fully interconnected nature without isolated nodes, fitting the definition of a clique.

**Conclusion**

Given the analysis, the pattern type observed in the graph image is a clique, characterized by fully interconnected nodes within each cluster.
