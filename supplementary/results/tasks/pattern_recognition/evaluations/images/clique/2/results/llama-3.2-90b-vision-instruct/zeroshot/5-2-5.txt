**Answer:**


```json
{
  'pattern': 'N/A - no image provided',
  'number_of_patterns': 'N/A',
  'analysis': 'Unable to analyze the image as it is not provided'
}
```


**Explanation:**

*   Since the image is not provided, it is impossible to determine the type of pattern present in the graph.
*   Without visual information, analysis cannot be conducted.
