   "analysis": "The graph shows two distinct clique patterns. The first clique consists of nodes 0,1,2,3,4 where each node is connected to every other node in its group. The second clique consists of nodes 5,6,7,8,9 with similar full interconnections. Both groups demonstrate the defining characteristic of a clique pattern where each node has direct connections to all other nodes within its cluster. This creates a fully interconnected subgraph in both cases. The two cliques are separate from each other with no connections between them, making it clear there are exactly 2 clique patterns in this graph."
