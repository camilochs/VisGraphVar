**Pattern Identification**

After analyzing the graph image, we can identify the pattern type as follows:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of two distinct clusters. The first cluster has a central node (5) connected to three peripheral nodes (3, 4, and 5). The second cluster also has a central node (1) connected to three peripheral nodes (0, 1, and 2). This layout corresponds to the "star" pattern, where a central node is surrounded by peripheral nodes.'
}
```

In this analysis, we observed two clusters with distinct central nodes surrounded by peripheral nodes, fitting the "star" pattern description.
