**Pattern Recognition in the Graph Image**

**Step 1: Initial Observation**
Upon analyzing the given graph image, we notice two distinct clusters of nodes. These clusters are not directly connected to each other but within each cluster, the nodes are interconnected.

**Step 2: Identifying Distinct Clusters**
- **Cluster 1 (Top-Right):** This cluster consists of 5 nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each node in this cluster is directly connected to every other node within the cluster.
- **Cluster 2 (Bottom-Left):** This cluster comprises 5 nodes labeled 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Similar to Cluster 1, each node in Cluster 2 is directly connected to every other node within the cluster.

**Step 3: Determining Pattern Types**
- Both clusters demonstrate the characteristic of a clique, where every node is directly connected to every other node within the same cluster.

**Step 4: Counting Instances of Each Pattern**
- There are two instances of the clique pattern, one in each cluster.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'Upon observing the graph, two distinct clusters were identified, each characterized by all nodes being interconnected with each other, fitting the definition of cliques. Thus, the graph contains two instances of the clique pattern.'
