**Graph Pattern Analysis**

To identify the pattern type, we will analyze the given graph following the provided step-by-step method:

1. **Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**

   The graph consists of two separate subgraphs or components. Each component has a central node connected to peripheral nodes. There are no isolated nodes, and all nodes within each component are interconnected to some degree.

2. **Determine the Interconnection Type (Chain, Clique, or Star)**

   - A chain would imply nodes connected in a linear sequence of at least three nodes, which is not observed here.
   - A clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent; every pair of vertices in the subgraph are connected. This does not fully apply to the given components as there's at least one case where two nodes are not directly connected unless through the central node.
   - A star pattern indicates a central node that connects to every other node in its vicinity directly, not necessarily forming a full clique with every vertex connected to every other vertex.

3. **Count Instances of Each Identified Pattern**

   There are two instances of the star pattern in the graph - one for each cluster of nodes (labeled 1-3 and 4-7). These patterns are evident due to the presence of a central node facilitating connections among otherwise separate nodes.

4. **Conclusion**

   Based on the analysis, the graph exhibits two 'star' patterns, with each component centered around a key node from which connections are made to other nodes within the respective subgraphs.

**Conclusion and Analysis in JSON Format:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'The graph is divided into two components, each structured as a "star" with a central node connecting to surrounding peripheral nodes. The presence of these central nodes facilitating connections among other nodes, without necessitating direct links between all peripheral nodes, points towards the identification of a star pattern in these discrete groups.'
}
```

This analysis indicates that the pattern observed in the graph is characteristic of a star configuration due to the central-peripheral relationship within each disconnected subset of nodes.
