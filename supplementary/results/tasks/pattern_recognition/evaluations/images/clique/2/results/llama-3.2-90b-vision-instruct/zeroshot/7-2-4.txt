**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

Based on the provided graph image, I have identified the type of pattern it contains. Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
  "pattern": "clique",
  "number_of_patterns": 2,
  "analysis": "The graph contains two fully connected subgraphs, each representing a clique. In a clique, every node is directly connected to every other node, forming a complete graph. The presence of two distinct groups of nodes with complete connectivity indicates that the graph exhibits the clique pattern."
}
```

In this analysis:

*   I have identified the pattern type as "clique" based on the complete connectivity within each group of nodes.
*   The number of patterns found is 2, corresponding to the two fully connected subgraphs in the graph.
*   The analysis explains that the graph exhibits the clique pattern due to the presence of two distinct groups of nodes with complete connectivity.
