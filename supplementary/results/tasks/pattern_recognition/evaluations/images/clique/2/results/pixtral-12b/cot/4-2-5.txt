   "analysis": "The graph image consists of two clusters, each forming a complete subgraph with all nodes interconnected.

   Step 1: We observe two clear distinct clusters:
      - One cluster on the left with nodes {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
      - Another cluster on the right with nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.

   Step 2: The nodes in each cluster are fully interconnected without any isolated nodes. This indicates a clique structure, where each node is connected to every other node within the same cluster.

   Step 3: Count:
      - Cluster 1 (left) has 5 nodes.
      - Cluster 2 (right) has 5 nodes.
      - Therefore, we have 2 distinct cliques.

   Step 4: The reasoning is that each node within a cluster is linked to every other node, fulfilling the property of a clique.
