**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we will analyze its structure and identify distinct clusters or links.

*   **Step 1: Observe the Structure**
    *   The graph consists of two separate clusters. Each cluster represents a distinct pattern.
*   **Step 2: Identify Patterns**
    *   **Cluster 1 (Left):**
        *   Nodes 4, 6, 5, and 7 are interconnected, forming a chain-like structure with multiple links between them.
        *   This is an example of a 'clique' because all nodes within this cluster are directly connected to each other.
    *   **Cluster 2 (Right):**
        *   Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 are connected in a star-like formation around node 0.
        *   Node 0 acts as the central node, with direct connections to nodes 1, 2, and 3, which do not have any connections among themselves.
        *   This arrangement defines a 'star' pattern.
*   **Step 3: Count Instances of Each Pattern**
    *   There is **1** instance of a 'clique' pattern and **1** instance of a 'star' pattern in the graph.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis:

```json
{
  'pattern': ['clique', 'star'],
  'number_of_patterns': 2,
  'analysis': 'The graph contains two clusters, one forming a clique where all nodes are interconnected, and another forming a star with a central node connected to peripheral nodes.'
}
