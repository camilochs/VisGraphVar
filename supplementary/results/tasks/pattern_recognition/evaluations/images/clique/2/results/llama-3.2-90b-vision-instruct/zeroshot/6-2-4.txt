To identify the pattern in the graph, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Components**: Break down the graph into its components. The graph image shows two distinct groups of nodes that are not connected to each other.

2. **Analyze Connectivity**:
   - In a chain pattern, nodes are connected sequentially but do not form a loop or allow multiple connections between any two nodes.
   - A clique is characterized by every node being directly connected to every other node.
   - A star pattern involves one central node connected to multiple other nodes, which are not connected to each other.

3. **Detect Patterns**:
   - Observe the connections within each component. The first component (upper right) shows that every node is directly connected to every other node within that component, which is indicative of a clique.
   - The second component (bottom left) has a central node connected to three other nodes, none of which are connected to each other, fitting the definition of a star pattern.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the connectivity and structure observed, one component forms a clique and the other forms a star. There's only one instance of each pattern observed in the graph.

**Answer**: 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'The presence of a fully connected subset of nodes indicates a clique, while a central node connected to multiple non-connected nodes indicates a star pattern.'
}
