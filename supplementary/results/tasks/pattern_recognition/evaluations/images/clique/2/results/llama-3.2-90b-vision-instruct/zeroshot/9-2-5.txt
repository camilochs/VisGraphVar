**Step 1: Identify the pattern.**

Two connected triangles can be seen in the graph.


**Step 2: Count the patterns for the given result.**

A total of $2$ connected triangles (cliques) are depicted.


**Step 3: Get the overall conclusion.**

The graph includes two connected triangles, resulting in exactly $2$ cliques of size $3$. The image does not depict any chains or stars.

This can be represented in the answer format shown below: 

*answer*: {
'pattern': ['clique'],
'number_of_patterns': [2],
'analysis': 'In the graph provided, there are 2 cliques of size 3, resulting in a total of 2 cliques as chain or star patterns were non-existent.'
}
