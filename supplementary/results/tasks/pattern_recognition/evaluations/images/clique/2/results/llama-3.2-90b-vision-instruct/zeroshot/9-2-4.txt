Analyzing the provided image description, though the image itself is not visible, the given details indicate that the graph consists of two clusters. The cluster that can reveal information is Cluster A. Cluster A has three edges, excluding a fourth edge that could make it a clique pattern. The nodes are numerically labeled and interconnected. 

By excluding the edge that could transform Cluster A into a clique pattern, no remaining configuration features are provided to conclusively classify it as another specific pattern. As a result, the only information available is the data about Cluster A and could be interpreted into the JSON format as follows:


```json
{
    'pattern': 'clique',
    'number_of_patterns': 1,
    'analysis': 'Cluster A is made up of 3 edges to form this shape by omitting the edge that would transform Cluster A pattern.'
}
```
