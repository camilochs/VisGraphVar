**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern type in the provided graph image, we need to examine its structure and compare it with the characteristics of 'chain,' 'clique,' and 'star' patterns.

*   **Chain Pattern:** A chain pattern typically involves nodes connected linearly one after the other, where each node (except the first and last) is directly connected to exactly two other nodes.
*   **Clique Pattern:** In a clique, all nodes are directly connected to every other node, which is not evident in the given image as there are disconnected nodes and not all nodes connect to every other node.
*   **Star Pattern:** A star pattern consists of a central node connected to all other nodes, while these other nodes do not connect to each other. This pattern is visible in the graph.

Given these definitions:

*   The graph does not follow a chain pattern because there are multiple connections between nodes beyond just sequential connections.
*   It does not form a clique due to the lack of connections between all possible nodes.
*   However, the presence of a central node connected to all peripheral nodes, with these peripheral nodes not connecting to each other, suggests a star pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the graph follows a star pattern. There is one instance of this pattern observed.

**JSON Response:**
