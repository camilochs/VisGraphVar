**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph image, let's examine its structure.

* The graph consists of two separate subgraphs:
	+ A subgraph at the top left containing vertices 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
	+ A subgraph at the bottom right containing vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Upon analyzing the connectivity:

* Each vertex in both subgraphs is connected to every other vertex within its respective subgraph.
* There are no edges connecting vertices between the two subgraphs.

This connectivity indicates that each subgraph forms a **clique**, as defined by the mutual connections among all vertices within each subgraph. Given this analysis, the pattern type is a **clique**, and there are **two clique patterns** present in the graph.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [2],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains two subgraphs where every vertex is connected to every other vertex within the same subgraph, but there are no connections between the two subgraphs, indicating two disjoint cliques.'
}
```
