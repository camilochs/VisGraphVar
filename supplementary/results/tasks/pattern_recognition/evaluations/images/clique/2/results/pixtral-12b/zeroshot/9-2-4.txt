   'analysis': 'The graph contains two patterns, both of which are cliques. A clique is defined as a subset of a graph in which every pair of vertices is adjacent. The first clique consists of four vertices: 0, 1, 2, and 3, all interconnected. The second clique consists of four vertices: 4, 5, 6, and 7, also fully interconnected. These patterns highlight highly connected subgraphs within the broader graph.'
