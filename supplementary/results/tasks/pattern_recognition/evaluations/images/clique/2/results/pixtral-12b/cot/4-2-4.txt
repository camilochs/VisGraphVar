       1. The first cluster consists of nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7, all of which are interconnected with each other. This is characteristic of a clique, wherein each node is connected to every other node within the cluster.

       2. The second cluster consists of nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, forming another fully interconnected group where every node is connected to every other node within the cluster.

       By following the steps to identify clusters and analyzing the nature of connections in each cluster, this graph contains two cliques.'
