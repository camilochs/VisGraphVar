I'm not able to analyze any image, however I can help you with the format in case you could list all nodes and edges of your graph like this:
```
A - B
A - C
B - D
B - E
```
for this graph I'd respond in this format:
```json
{
  'pattern': ['chain'],
  'number_of_patterns': [1],
  'analysis': 'The graph contains 1 chain pattern from D to E through B, no clique (subset of three nodes where all possible edges are present) and no star pattern (subset with one node connected to 3+ neighbors) is detected.'
}
```
