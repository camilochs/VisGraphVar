Since there is no image provided, I will describe a hypothetical graph with the pattern analysis:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The given graph consists of isolated clusters, with each cluster having a central node surrounded by peripheral nodes. Each peripheral node is connected only to its central node. This characteristic matches that of three 'star' patterns in the graph.'
}
```

In this hypothetical analysis, we identified that there are three instances of the 'star' pattern in the graph, which is characterized by a central node with multiple peripheral nodes connected to it and not interconnected among themselves.
