   'analysis': 'The graph consists of three distinct patterns, all of which conform to the "star" format. Each "star" pattern features a central node connected to several peripheral nodes. Specifically: 
    - The top-right cluster has a central node labeled "7" with peripheral nodes "8," "9," and "6."
    - The bottom-left cluster has a central node labeled "1" with peripheral nodes "0,"  "2," and "3."
    - The top-left cluster has a central node labeled "10" with peripheral nodes "11," "12," "13," and "14."
   These arrangements indicate a star formation, where one central node is connected to multiple neighboring nodes, forming a clear and recognizable pattern.'
