   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct clique patterns. Each clique consists of 5 nodes where every node is connected to every other node within its group, forming a complete subgraph. These cliques are separated from each other and can be found at the top (nodes 5-9), middle-right (nodes 10-14), and bottom-left (nodes 0-4) of the image."
