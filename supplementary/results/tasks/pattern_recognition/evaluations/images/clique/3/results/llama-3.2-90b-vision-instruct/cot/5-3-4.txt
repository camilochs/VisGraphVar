**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we need to analyze its structure and relationships between nodes.

**Identifying Clusters and Interconnectedness**

1. **Cluster Identification**: The graph consists of three distinct groups or clusters, each containing differently numbered nodes. These clusters are not interconnected with each other.
2. **Internal Connections**: Within each cluster, all nodes are directly linked to one another, forming a small network where every node is connected to every other node within its cluster.

**Pattern Recognition**

- **Clique**: Since all nodes within a cluster are interconnected, and there are no isolated nodes or a central node dominating the connections, these clusters represent cliques.
- **Counting Cliques**: There are three such clusters (or cliques) in the graph.

**Conclusion**

Given the analysis, the graph exhibits multiple instances of a single pattern type: 'clique'. Each cluster is a clique because all its nodes are fully interconnected. The presence of three such independent groups indicates there are three instances of the clique pattern in the graph.

**Answer**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of three fully interconnected node groups (cliques), each with all nodes linked to each other. This structure defines a clique pattern, and since there are three such independent groups, there are three cliques in total.'
}
