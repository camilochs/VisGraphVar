   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph contains three distinct cliques, each of which represents a fully connected subset of vertices. In each clique, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, indicating a high level of interconnection among the vertices within the subsets.'
}
```

Each clique is clearly a group where every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex in the group, ensuring full connectivity within the subsets.
