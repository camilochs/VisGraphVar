**Step 1: Analyze the graph image**

The graph consists of three clusters of nodes. Each cluster is connected by an edge to one other node in the same cluster.

**Step 2: Identify the pattern type**

Based on the characteristics of the graph, we can identify the pattern as a clique because all the nodes within each cluster are connected to one another through an edge.

**Step 3: Count the number of patterns**

There are a total of three clusters in the graph, which means that there are three patterns detected, and each cluster corresponds to a clique.

**Step 4: Provide an analysis**

The analysis of the graph image shows that it represents a pattern of three disjoint cliques. The three clusters of nodes show a characteristic feature of a clique pattern, which closely matches the definition of a clique in graph theory.

**Final answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph exhibits a pattern of three disjoint cliques. The characteristic feature of a clique pattern is a group of nodes densely connected to each other by an edge.'
}
