**Analysis of the Graph Image**

After analyzing the graph image, it was determined that it contains a 'clique' pattern. 

**Pattern Detection:**
*   The type of pattern detected is 'clique'.
*   The number of patterns found is 3.

**Conclusion:**
The features in the graph that led me to my conclusion were that many, if not all, nodes are connected to each other. Furthermore, every possible edge (line connecting two nodes) is present between every pair of nodes.

**Result:**

```json
{
    "pattern": "clique",
    "number_of_patterns": 3,
    "analysis": "The graph contains a high number of interconnected nodes, with many or all nodes connected to each other, and every possible edge present between every pair of nodes."
}
