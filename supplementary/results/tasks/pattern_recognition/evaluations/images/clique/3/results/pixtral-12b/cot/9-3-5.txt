   "analysis": "1. Observing the graph, we see three distinct clusters of nodes.\n2. Each cluster consists of a group of interconnected nodes where every node is connected to every other node in the group. This pattern describes a 'clique.' In a clique, every combination of nodes is connected to each other, forming a fully interconnected subgraph.\n3. The clusters are found in the top left, top right, and bottom center of the image.\n4. This results in 3 instances of the clique pattern observed in the given graph."
