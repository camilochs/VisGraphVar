**Pattern Identification**

To identify the pattern in the given graph, we can analyze its structure and connectivity.

**Relevant Data:**

* The graph consists of multiple connected components.
* Each component has a limited number of nodes and edges.
* There are no dense subgraphs or clusters.

**Analysis:**

Upon examining the graph, we notice that each component resembles a small chain or a simple linear sequence of nodes. There are no evident cliques (fully connected subgraphs) or star patterns (a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes). Given the structure, where each component consists of just a few nodes in a sequence, the most appropriate pattern to describe the overall composition of the graph is a collection of "chain" patterns.

**Conclusion:**

```json
{
    'pattern': ['chain'],
    'number_of_patterns': 3,
    'analysis': 'The graph image shows several disconnected components, each consisting of a small number of nodes sequentially connected, characteristic of a chain pattern.'
}
```

This conclusion is based on the observation that each component in the graph represents a small chain, with no indication of cliques or star patterns.
