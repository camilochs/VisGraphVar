**Step 1: Identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.**

The image contains three distinct clusters of nodes, each with a different number of nodes and connections.

**Step 2: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').**

Cluster 1 consists of 4 nodes that are fully interconnected, forming a clique. Cluster 2 consists of 7 nodes that are also fully interconnected, forming another clique. Cluster 3 consists of 4 nodes that are fully interconnected, forming a third clique.

**Step 3: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.**

There are 3 instances of the 'clique' pattern.

**Step 4: Provide a step-by-step explanation of the graphâ€™s layout and why you identified this pattern.**

The graph consists of three distinct clusters of nodes, each with a different number of nodes and connections. Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that each cluster forms a clique, where all nodes are fully interconnected. This means that every node in each cluster is connected to every other node, with no isolated nodes or fragments. Given this observation, it is reasonable to conclude that the primary pattern in the graph is the 'clique' pattern.
