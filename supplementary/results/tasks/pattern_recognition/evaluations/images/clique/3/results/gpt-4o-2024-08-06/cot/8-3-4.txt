   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct groups of nodes, each fully interconnected without isolated nodes. The first clique includes nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7. The second clique consists of nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. The third clique is formed by nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11. Each group forms a fully connected subgraph, which characterizes a clique pattern."
