   "analysis": "The graph contains three separate clique patterns. Each subgraph shows a complete graph where every node is connected to every other node in its group. The groups are: (0,1,2,3,4), (5,6,7,8,9), and (10,11,12,13,14). Each of these forms a complete subgraph where all vertices are interconnected, which is the definition of a clique pattern."
