To identify the pattern types in the given graph image, follow these steps:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**
   - The graph consists of three groups of nodes interconnected in different ways.
   
2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star'):**
   - Group 1: Nodes 0, 1, and 2 are interconnected with 0 being central and 1 and 2 being peripheral. This resembles a star pattern.
   - Group 2: Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are interconnected in a triangular manner. This represents a fully interconnected clique.
   - Group 3: Nodes 6, 7, and 8 are interconnected in a triangular manner. This also represents a fully interconnected clique.

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:**
   - Star patterns: 1
   - Clique patterns: 2

4. **Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes:**
   - Group 1 follows a star pattern since node 0 is centrally connected to nodes 1 and 2.
   - Group 2 and Group 3 follow the clique pattern where each node is connected to every other node directly, forming a triangle.

Based on these observations, the analyzing pattern types in the provided graph is:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["star", "clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": [1, 2],
   "analysis": "The graph consists of three groups of nodes. Group 1 follows a star pattern with a central node 0 connected to two peripheral nodes (1 and 2). Group 2 and Group 3 each form a triangle, where every node is fully interconnected, thus resembling a clique pattern."
