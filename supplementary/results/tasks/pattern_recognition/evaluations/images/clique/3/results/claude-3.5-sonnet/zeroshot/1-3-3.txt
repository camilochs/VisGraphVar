    "analysis": "The graph shows three separate clique patterns. Each clique consists of 3 nodes where every node is connected to every other node within its group. We can see these triangular formations at nodes (3,4,5), (6,7,8), and (0,1,2), where each node has exactly two edges connecting it to the other nodes in its cluster."
