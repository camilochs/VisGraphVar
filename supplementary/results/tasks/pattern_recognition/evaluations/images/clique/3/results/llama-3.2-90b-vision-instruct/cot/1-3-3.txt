* The image presents a graph comprising three distinct clusters.
* Each cluster consists of interconnected nodes, forming a complete subgraph.

**Step 2: Pattern Classification**

* A chain is characterized by a linear sequence of interconnected nodes.
* A clique is an undirected simple graph in which every pair of distinct nodes is connected by an edge.
* Clusters in the image do not form chains, as they are not linear arrangements of nodes.
* However, clusters are cliques, meeting the definition of a clique: all pairs of distinct nodes are connected by an edge within each.

**Step 3: Counting Instances of Each Pattern**

* Three distinct clusters are present in the image.

**Step 4: Analysis and Conclusion**

* Based on the graph's layout and relationships among nodes, the observed pattern is a "clique."
* The number of patterns of this type is 3.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph comprises three distinct clusters, each serving as a clique in itself, with all pairs of distinct nodes connected by an edge within each cluster. There are no chain or star patterns present in the image.'
}
```

*Answer*: See above.
