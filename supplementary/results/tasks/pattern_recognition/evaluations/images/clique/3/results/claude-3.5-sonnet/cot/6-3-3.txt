   "analysis": "The graph shows three separate clusters, each containing three nodes fully connected to each other. In the first cluster, nodes 3, 4, and 5 are all interconnected. In the second cluster, nodes 6, 7, and 8 are all interconnected. In the third cluster, nodes 0, 1, and 2 are all interconnected. Each cluster forms a complete graph where every node is connected to every other node within its group, which is the definition of a clique. Since there are three separate groups with this same pattern, we can identify three distinct cliques in the graph."
