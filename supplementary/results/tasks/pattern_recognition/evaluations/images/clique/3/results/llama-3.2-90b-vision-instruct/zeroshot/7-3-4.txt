**Pattern Analysis**

The graph contains three distinct groups of nodes. To understand how these groups relate to potential patterns, let's examine each group and the overall structure.

*   The first group consists of nodes 1, 2, 3, and 0. These nodes are all directly connected to each other, indicating no single node is central to the others.
*   The second group includes nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7. Similar to the first group, these nodes are all connected to each other, with no single central node.
*   The third group comprises nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11, again with all nodes directly connected to each other, lacking a central node.

Given the structure where all nodes in each group are connected to each other directly without a single central node, this pattern aligns with the definition of a clique.

**Solution**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'All nodes within each group are directly connected to each other, forming cliques as there are no isolated or central nodes; each group exemplifies a clique pattern.'
}
```

**Conclusion**

The given graph consists of three distinct cliques, denoted by their fully interconnected nodes and the absence of central or isolated points within each group.
