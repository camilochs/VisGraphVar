To identify the pattern type in the given graph image, we need to analyze its structure and relationships among nodes.

**Pattern Identification Analysis:**

1. Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:
   - The graph consists of three isolated groups of nodes.
   - Each group contains a maximum of three nodes.

2. Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star'):
   - Each group is fully interconnected without isolated nodes, indicating that they are cliques.

3. Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:
   - There are three instances of the 'clique' pattern.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the pattern type in the given graph image is 'clique,' and there are three instances of this pattern.

**Pattern Identification Answer:**
```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of three isolated groups of nodes, each fully interconnected without isolated nodes, indicating that they are cliques.'
}
