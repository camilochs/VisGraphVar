The graph displays three small subgraphs, each of which forms a distinct pattern within the larger graph. 

Through analysis, it is clear that these subgraphs adhere to the characteristics of cliques, where every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex in each subgraph. Each subgraph contains exactly 3 vertices, with each vertex directly connected to the other two, conforming to the definition of a clique in graph theory.

Given the presence of three distinct subgraphs of this form, it can be concluded that the pattern type identified is a "clique" and the number of these patterns observed in this graph is 3.

**Answer:** 

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "Three small subgraphs form cliques, characterized by each vertex connecting to every other vertex within the subgraph."
}
