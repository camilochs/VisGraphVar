   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct groups of nodes. In each group, all nodes are interconnected directly, forming a complete subgraph, or 'clique.' There are no isolated nodes, and each group of four nodes shares edges with every other node in that group. This pattern repeats itself three times across the graph, indicating the presence of three cliques."
