**Analysis of the Graph Image**

### Pattern Identification

To determine the pattern type, we will analyze the given graph image.

The graph comprises three distinct subgraphs:

* Top-left: 4 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3) fully connected, forming a clique.
* Bottom-left: 4 nodes (5, 6, 7, 8) fully connected, forming a clique.
* Bottom-right: 4 nodes (10, 11, 12, 13) fully connected, with an additional central node (9) connected to all four nodes.

The graph contains multiple fully connected subgraphs, some with an added central node.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the type of pattern in the given graph image is the 'clique' pattern. There are 3 sets of 4 fully connected nodes and 1 set of 5 nodes with a central node connected to all 4 outer nodes.
