**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we need to carefully observe its structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links. The graph consists of three separate clusters with nodes interconnected within each cluster but not between the clusters.

Upon closer inspection, each cluster appears to be fully interconnected without any isolated nodes. This characteristic aligns with the definition of a 'clique,' where every node is connected to every other node within the same cluster.

Given this observation, we can conclude that the pattern type present in the graph is a 'clique.' Since there are three distinct clusters following this pattern, we can count a total of 3 instances of this pattern type in the image.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of three fully interconnected clusters with no isolated nodes, fitting the definition of a clique.'
}
```

This analysis confirms that the graph exhibits a 'clique' pattern due to the complete interconnection among nodes within each cluster, accompanied by a total count of three such patterns.
