Here is the detailed analysis:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of three distinct clusters of nodes, where each cluster has all of its nodes interconnected with each other. 

   1. **Step 1**: Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.
      - The graph is divided into three separate groupings of nodes.

   2. **Step 2**: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').
      - For each cluster, every node is connected with every other node. This is indicative of a fully interconnected set, known as a clique.

   3. **Step 3**: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.
      - There are three cliques in the graph.

   4. **Step 4**: Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes.
      - Each cluster in the graph represents a set of fully interconnected nodes where each node is directly connected to every other node in that particular subset. This characteristic is exclusive to cliques, where every node is adjacent to every other node within the subset.'
