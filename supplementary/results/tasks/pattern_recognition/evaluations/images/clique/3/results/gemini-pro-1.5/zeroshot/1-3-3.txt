  "analysis": "The graph contains three sets of interconnected nodes. Each set of nodes forms a complete subgraph, where every node is directly connected to every other node within the same subgraph. In other words, if we consider each small group as a separate graph on its own, its vertices and edges represent a clique because every node within it has an edge to every other node.  There are no other visible patterns in this graph."
