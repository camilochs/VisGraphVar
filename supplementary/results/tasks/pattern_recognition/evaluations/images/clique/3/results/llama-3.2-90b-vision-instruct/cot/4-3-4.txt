The graph consists of three groups of interconnected nodes. Each group has a central node with peripheral nodes that are not directly connected to each other.

**Group 1:**
- Central node: 11
- Peripheral nodes: 8, 9, 10

**Group 2:**
- Central node: 7
- Peripheral nodes: 4, 5, 6

**Group 3:**
- Central node: 3
- Peripheral nodes: 0, 1, 2

Each group represents a "star" pattern because there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes that are not interconnected among themselves.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph showcases three distinct groups, each comprising a central node surrounded by peripheral nodes that do not have direct connections among themselves. This configuration is characteristic of a star pattern, resulting in a network of three stars within the graph.'
}
