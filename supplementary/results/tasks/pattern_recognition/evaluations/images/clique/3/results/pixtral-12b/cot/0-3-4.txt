Here is the analysis of the graph image based on the steps provided:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "1. Observing the structure, it can be seen that each separate group of nodes interconnects fully without any nodes being left out in terms of direct connections. 
                2. This fully interconnected structure without isolated nodes indicates that they form cliques, where every node is connected to every other node within the group.
                3. There are three distinct clusters present in the image, where each cluster has nodes fully interconnected with each other.
                4. As a result, the pattern type for this graph is 'clique' which represents a group of nodes that are all connected to each other."
}
```

In this case, the identified pattern type is "clique" due to the fully interconnected nature of the nodes within each cluster. The graph consists of three such cliques.
