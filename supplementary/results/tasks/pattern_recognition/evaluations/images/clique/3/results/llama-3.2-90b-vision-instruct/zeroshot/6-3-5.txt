The graph image contains a combination of patterns. In the top-right corner, there is a clique pattern consisting of four directly connected nodes (10-13). 

A similar clique pattern is observed in the bottom-right corner, involving four nodes (0-2, 4). 

In the bottom-left corner, there is another clique pattern comprising four nodes (5-7, 9). 

However, within each cluster or clique, the nodes are interconnected, indicating a chain-like structure. 

Given these observations, the response in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  'pattern': ['clique', 'chain'],
  'number_of_patterns': 3,
  'analysis': 'The graph shows multiple instances of the clique pattern, characterized by all nodes being directly connected to each other within their respective groups. Additionally, each group exhibits a chain-like structure, as the nodes are interconnected.'
}
```
