Based on the provided image, let's analyze the graph structure step-by-step:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**
   The graph consists of three separate clusters. Each cluster contains a set of nodes that are fully interconnected with each other.

2. **Determine the specific pattern type of the clusters:**
   - In each cluster, all nodes are interconnected without any isolated nodes.
   - This is characteristic of a **'clique'**, where each subset of nodes is fully connected to every other node within the subset.

3. **Count the instances of each identified pattern:**
   - There are three distinct clusters.
   - Each cluster fits the 'clique' pattern type.

4. **Explanation of reasoning:**
   - **First Cluster:** Nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 are fully interconnected.
   - **Second Cluster:** Nodes labeled 4, 5, 6, and 7 are fully interconnected.
   - **Third Cluster:** Nodes labeled 8, 9, 10, and 11 are fully interconnected.

Thus, we have a total of three 'clique' patterns in the graph.
