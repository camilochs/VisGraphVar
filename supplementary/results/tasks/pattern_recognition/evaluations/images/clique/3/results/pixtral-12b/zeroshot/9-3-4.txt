Based on the graph image provided, here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ["star"],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': "The graph displays three distinct star patterns. Each star pattern comprises a central node connected to peripheral nodes, indicating that the central node has higher connectivity compared to the peripheral nodes. These stars are organized such that each node with higher connectivity (hub) is surrounded by less connected nodes, and there are no other complex structures such as chains or larger cliques present."
