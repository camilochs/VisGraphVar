   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct groups of nodes. Each group has exactly four nodes, and within each group, every node is interconnected with the other nodes, forming a tightly-knit structure with no isolated nodes. This complete interconnection within each group identifies them as cliques. The groups are separate from each other, and there is no connection between the groups themselves, reinforcing their classification as distinct cliques. Hence, there are three cliques in total."
