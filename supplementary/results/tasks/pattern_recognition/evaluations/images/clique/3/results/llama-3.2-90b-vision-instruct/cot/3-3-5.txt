**Pattern Analysis of the Graph**

**Step 1: Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**

Upon analyzing the graph, we observe three clusters:

*   Cluster A (top-left): 3-1-2-4-0
*   Cluster B (bottom-left): 9-5-6-7-8
*   Cluster C (bottom-right): 10-13-12-14-11

No clusters follow a continuous sequence (characteristic of a 'chain'). Instead, nodes within each cluster are fully interconnected without isolated nodes.

**Step 2: Determine Interconnectedness and Node Arrangement**

Each cluster exhibits a characteristic similar to a clique, with nodes largely interlinked within their respective groups. Notably, there are no central nodes surrounded by peripheral nodes indicative of a 'star' pattern.

**Step 3: Conclusion on Pattern Type and Count**

Based on the interconnectedness within clusters and the absence of chain or star structures, we conclude that the graph primarily features clique patterns.

Given there are three instances of such interlinked groups across the graph, we can assert the following:

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
  "pattern": ["clique"],
  "number_of_patterns": 3,
  "analysis": "The graph is characterized by three distinct clusters where nodes within each are fully interconnected, resembling the clique pattern. This arrangement does not fit the criteria for a chain or a star, solidifying the identification of a clique pattern in these clusters."
}
