  "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct groups of nodes.  In each group, every node is directly connected to every other node within the same group. This fully interconnected characteristic within each group defines them as cliques. Group 1 consists of nodes 0, 1, and 2. Group 2 consists of nodes 3, 4, and 5. Group 3 consists of nodes 6, 7, and 8. There are no connections between the different groups.  Therefore, there are three separate cliques present in the graph."
