   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "To identify the pattern, we observed the structure of the graph and noted that each cluster of nodes is fully interconnected without any isolated nodes. In each of the three clusters, every node is connected to every other node present in the same cluster. This indicates that the pattern type for each group is a 'clique' where all members are directly connected. Thus, there are three instances of fully interconnected cliques in the provided graphical layout."
