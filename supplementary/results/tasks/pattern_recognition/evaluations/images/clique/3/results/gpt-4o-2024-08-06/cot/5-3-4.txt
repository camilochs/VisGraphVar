   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct groups of nodes that are fully interconnected. Each group forms a 'clique,' where every node connects to all the others in its group, with no isolated nodes. The first clique consists of nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. The second clique is made up of nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7. The third clique includes nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11. No central nodes or linear chains are present, confirming the presence of cliques."
