To analyze the graph image, we will follow the steps outlined to identify the pattern types. Let's proceed:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters:**
   - The graph contains three distinct clusters.

2. **Determine the pattern type for each cluster based on node connectivity:**
   - The first cluster located in the top center:
      - Nodes: 6, 7, 8, 9, 5 (all connected without obvious central/subordinate relationships).
      - **Pattern:** This cluster is fully interconnected without isolated nodes, indicating a **clique**.
   - The second cluster located in the bottom left:
      - Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (similar connectivity).
      - **Pattern:** This cluster is also fully interconnected without isolated nodes, indicating another **clique**.
   - The third cluster located in the bottom right:
      - Nodes: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 (similar connectivity).
      - **Pattern:** This cluster is similarly fully interconnected without isolated nodes, indicating yet another **clique**.

3. **Count the number of instances of each identified pattern:**
   - Clique: 3 instances

4. **Explain the reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes:**
   - Each cluster does not have a central node but rather all nodes connect to each other forming a complete subgraph.

Therefore, the pattern identified is "clique."

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": [3],
   "analysis": "Step 1: Observe that there are three distinct clusters in the graph. Step 2: Determine the connectivity within each cluster. The first, second, and third clusters each have fully interconnected nodes without isolated nodes. Step 3: Count the instances of fully interconnected clusters. Step 4: Each cluster is a 'clique', indicating a complete subgraph where every node is connected to every other node."
