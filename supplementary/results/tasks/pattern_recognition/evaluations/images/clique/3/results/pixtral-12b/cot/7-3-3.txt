   "analysis": "The graph consists of multiple clusters, each containing three nodes. Each cluster can be observed to have a central node (nodes 2, 5, and 7) connected to two other peripheral nodes (nodes 0, 3, and 6 in corresponding clusters). This connecting style with a central node linked to peripheral nodes is characteristic of a 'star' pattern. Therefore, there are three such star patterns in the graph."
