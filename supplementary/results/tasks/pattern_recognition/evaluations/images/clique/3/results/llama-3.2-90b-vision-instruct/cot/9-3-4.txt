Based on the graph image, I have identified the following patterns:

**Pattern: 'clique'**

**Number of Patterns: 3**

**Analysis:** The graph consists of three distinct clusters of interconnected nodes. Each cluster has a set of nodes that are fully connected to each other, with no isolated nodes or nodes that are not part of the cluster. This indicates that each cluster is a clique. There are three such cliques in the graph.

**JSON Response:**

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "The graph has three distinct clusters of interconnected nodes, each forming a clique with no isolated nodes or peripheral nodes."
}
```

Therefore, the correct answer is **'clique'**.
