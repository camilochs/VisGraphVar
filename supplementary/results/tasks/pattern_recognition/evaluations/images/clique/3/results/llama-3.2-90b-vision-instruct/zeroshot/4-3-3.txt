Since the actual image is not provided, I'm unable to analyze it. However, I can give you a response based on a hypothetical graph image.

Assuming the graph image contains a pattern where there is a central node connected to multiple nodes, and these nodes are not connected to each other, the response would be:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1],
   'analysis': 'The graph contains a central node that connects to multiple other nodes. These connected nodes do not have any edges between them, forming a star pattern.'
}
```

Please provide the actual graph image for a more accurate analysis.
