**Pattern Analysis**

To analyze the pattern in the provided graph image, we need to examine its structure and connections.

*   The graph consists of nodes (represented by circles) and edges (represented by lines connecting these nodes).
*   There are three distinct clusters within the graph.
*   Each cluster has a central node connected to multiple other nodes directly.
*   These central nodes are not directly connected to each other.
*   The nodes connected to the central nodes in each cluster are not directly connected to each other within their respective cluster.

Given these observations, the pattern resembles a 'star' configuration in graph theory because:
*   A star pattern is characterized by a central node (or hub) connected to several peripheral nodes.
*   Each of the identified clusters follows this structure, with one central node and multiple peripheral nodes, fitting the definition of a star pattern.

**Result**
