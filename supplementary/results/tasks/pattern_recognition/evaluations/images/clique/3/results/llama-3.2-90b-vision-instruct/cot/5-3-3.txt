**Step 1: Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.**

The graph image shows three distinct clusters of nodes.

*   Cluster 1 contains nodes 0, 1, and 2.
*   Cluster 2 contains nodes 3, 4, and 5.
*   Cluster 3 contains nodes 6, 7, and 8.

**Step 2: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').**

Upon closer inspection, it's clear that within each cluster, all nodes are interconnected. There are no isolated nodes or a central node with peripheral nodes within any of the clusters.

**Step 3: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.**

Based on the observation from Step 2, all three clusters represent cliques because they are fully interconnected without any isolated nodes. Therefore, there are three instances of the clique pattern in the graph.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'Each cluster in the graph exhibits full interconnection among its nodes, indicating a clique pattern. This pattern type is consistent across all three observed clusters.'
}
