**Step 1: Analyze the Vertex Chain**

*   Vertex pairs (5, 6) and (7, 4) form edges connecting to one another.
*   Each pair forms an edge that connects each other in their respective order.

**Step 2: Identify Clusters**

*   Vertex 0 connecting to a chain consisting of edges (1, 2), (2, 3) to form a clique.
*   Vertices 8 and 9 connect directly with one another and also to vertex 10.
* Vertices 10 and 11 form an edge connecting to one another.

**Step 3: Determine Type of Patterns**

*   For each vertex connecting to multiples (8>2), the vertex sink is said to form a star.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis of the edges and vertex connections, the graph contains the star pattern.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
    'pattern': ['Star'],
    'number_of_patterns': [5],
    'analysis': 'The vertex chains and cliques do not fall into patterns called "chain" or "clique" because of the multiple connections with the sink vertices, which define these patterns as chains.'
}
