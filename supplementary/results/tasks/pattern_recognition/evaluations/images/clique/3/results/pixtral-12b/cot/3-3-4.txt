   "analysis": "1. Observing the structure of the graph, we find distinct clusters of four nodes at different positions in the plane.
                2. Each cluster has a central node that is connected to three surrounding nodes indicating a star pattern.
                3. There are no continuous sequences (chains) or fully interconnected sets without isolated nodes (cliques).
                4. Specifically, at the bottom left, the cluster around node 4 has nodes 4, 5, 6, 7 forming a star. At the center, the cluster around node 0 has nodes 0, 1, 2, 3 forming a star. At the top right, the cluster around node 8 has nodes 8, 9, 10, 11 forming a star.
                5. Therefore, we conclude there are 3 instances of star patterns in the graph."
