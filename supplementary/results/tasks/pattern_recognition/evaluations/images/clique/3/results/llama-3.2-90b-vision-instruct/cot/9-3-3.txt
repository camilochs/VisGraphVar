Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a solution without a graph image to analyze.

You may consider using a network analysis technique called "community detection" to identify clusters or groups in the graph. This method involves dividing the network into densely connected subnetworks (i.e., communities), which can then be visualized and analyzed separately. 

Once you have identified possible clusters, you can use other network metrics such as degree centrality and betweenness centrality to further characterize the structure.

Here is a placeholder JSON response:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'Please provide a graph image to analyze.',
   'number_of_patterns': 'Please provide a graph image to analyze.',
   'analysis': 'Please provide a graph image to analyze.'
}
```

Please let me know if I can help further.
