   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct clusters, each where all nodes are interconnected. To identify the pattern type:

   1. Observe the structure of the graph.
   2. Notice that each clusters (subgraphs) contains nodes where every node is connected to every other node in that cluster, indicating a fully connected graph.
   3. Compare clusters to the common pattern types: chain, clique, and star.
       - A chain would have nodes in a continuous sequence, which is not present here.
       - A star would have a central node with peripheral nodes.
       - A clique is defined by all nodes being interconnected.
   4. Identify the pattern as 'cliques' since every node in each cluster is fully interconnected.
   5. Count the number of such fully interconnected clusters, which are 3 in this graph."
