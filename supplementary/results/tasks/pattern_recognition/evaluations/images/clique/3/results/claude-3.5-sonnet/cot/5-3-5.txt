   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct clique patterns. Each clique consists of 5 nodes that are fully interconnected with each other. The first clique includes nodes 0-4, the second clique contains nodes 5-9, and the third clique consists of nodes 10-14. In each clique, every node is connected to all other nodes within its group, forming a complete subgraph. The cliques are separated from each other with no connections between them. This creates three independent, fully-connected clusters in the graph."
