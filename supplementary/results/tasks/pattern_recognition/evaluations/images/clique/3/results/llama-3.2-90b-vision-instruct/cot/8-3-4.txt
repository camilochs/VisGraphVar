**Graph Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the graph, observe the node connections and groupings.

* **Distinct Clusters**: Three separate clusters are visible:
	+ Cluster 1: Nodes 5, 6, and 7.
	+ Cluster 2: Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
	+ Cluster 3: Nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11.
* **Node Connections**: Each cluster forms a fully connected group with internal links.
* **Pattern Type**: Each of these clusters represents a 'clique,' as they are fully interconnected without isolated nodes.

**Conclusion**

   'analysis': 'The graph consists of three separate fully connected clusters, each representing a clique pattern.'
