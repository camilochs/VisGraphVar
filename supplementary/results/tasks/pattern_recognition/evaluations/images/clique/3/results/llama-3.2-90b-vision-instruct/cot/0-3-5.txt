**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type, we closely examine the structure of the graph and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.

1.  **Identifying Clusters**: The graph consists of three distinct clusters. Each cluster is composed of multiple interconnected nodes.
2.  **Determining Pattern Type**: All three clusters are fully interconnected without isolated nodes, indicating that they are representing a 'clique'.
3.  **Counting Patterns**: There are three instances of the 'clique' pattern in the graph.

**Conclusion**

The pattern type is identified as a 'clique' due to the full interconnection of nodes within each cluster, and there are three instances of this pattern in the graph.
