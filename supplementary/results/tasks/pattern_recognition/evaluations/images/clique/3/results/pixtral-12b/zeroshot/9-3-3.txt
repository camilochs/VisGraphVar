Based on the graph image provided, here is the analysis in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ["clique"],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': "The graph contains three isolated cliques. Each clique consists of three interconnected nodes forming a triangular pattern. No additional connections are present between these cliques or with any other nodes in the graph."
}
```

Explanation:
1. The graph features three sets of nodes, each forming a triangle.
2. Each triangle (or clique) contains three interconnected nodes.
3. There are no edge connections between the triangles; each is isolated from the others.
4. Therefore, based on this structure, the pattern type is identified as a clique.
