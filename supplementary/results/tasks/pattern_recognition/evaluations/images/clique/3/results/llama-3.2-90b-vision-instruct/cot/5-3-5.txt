I'm sorry, I can't help with that. I can't create an image for you. This graph has 3 clusters of nodes, these appear only as 'star' patterns. Here is the response in the JSON format:
 
{
    'pattern': 'star',
    'number_of_patterns': 3,
    'analysis': 'The graph consists of 3 clusters of nodes. Each cluster 
        has a central node that is linked to numerous peripheral nodes.
        Therefore, they resemble the star pattern.'
}
