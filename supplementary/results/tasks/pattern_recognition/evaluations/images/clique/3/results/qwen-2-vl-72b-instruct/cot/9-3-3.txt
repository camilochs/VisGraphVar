The provided graph consists of an undirected graph with nodes and edges connecting the nodes. The nodes are labeled with integers from 0 to 8. Let us analyze the graph step-by-step to identify the pattern type.

1. **Identify distinct clusters:**
   - There are three distinct clusters of nodes:
     - Cluster 1: Messages containing nodes 0, 1, and 2
     - Cluster 2: Messages containing nodes 3, 4, and 5
     - Cluster 3: Messages containing nodes 6, 7, and 8

2. **Determine the pattern in each cluster:**
   - In each cluster, all nodes are interconnected, indicating that all nodes are connected to each other within the cluster.

3. **Identify the pattern type:**
   - Each cluster is fully interconnected without any nodes being isolated or forming chains or stars. This means that all nodes within each cluster are connected to each other in a clique-like structure.

4. **Count the number of instances of each pattern:**
   - There are three instances of this pattern.

5. **Explain the analysis:**
   - The graph is divided into three clusters, each of which forms a clique where all nodes within the cluster are interconnected. There are no isolated nodes or chains present in the graph. The graph does not have a star-like structure where a central node is connected to all other nodes, but the nodes in each cluster are all directly connected to each other.
