   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct groups of nodes. Each group has four nodes that are all interconnected, with no isolated nodes. This makes each group a 'clique.' The first clique consists of nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3; the second clique consists of nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7; and the third clique consists of nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11. The layout and full interconnectivity among nodes in each group confirm the presence of the 'clique' pattern."
