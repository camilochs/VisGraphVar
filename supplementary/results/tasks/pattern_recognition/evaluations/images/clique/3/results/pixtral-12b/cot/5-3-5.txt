   'analysis': 'To identify the pattern, we observe the structure and relationships among the nodes in the graph. There are three distinct clusters of nodes. Each cluster consists of a central node with peripheral nodes connected to it. 

   1. In the first cluster located at the bottom left, node 0 is the central node with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 surrounding it.
   2. The second cluster at the top center has node 10 as the central node with nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 surrounding it.
   3. The third cluster at the bottom right has node 5 as the central node with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 surrounding it.

   Based on this arrangement, each cluster has the characteristics of a "star" pattern. There are no chains or fully interconnected cliques observed in this graph.'
