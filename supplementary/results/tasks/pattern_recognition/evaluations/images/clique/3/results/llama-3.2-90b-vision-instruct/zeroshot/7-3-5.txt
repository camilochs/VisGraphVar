**Analysis of the Graph Image**

After carefully examining the graph image, I have identified the type of pattern it contains.

**Pattern Type:** Star

**Number of Patterns:** 3

**Analysis:**

The graph image displays three distinct patterns, each resembling a star. A star pattern is characterized by a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, with no connections between the peripheral nodes. In this case, each of the three patterns has a central node (labeled 6, 13, and 1) connected to four peripheral nodes (labeled 7, 8, 9, 5, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 0, 2, 3, 4). There are no connections between the peripheral nodes within each pattern, which is a defining feature of a star pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, I conclude that the graph image contains three star patterns. The central nodes in each pattern are connected to multiple peripheral nodes, with no connections between the peripheral nodes, which is a characteristic of a star pattern.
