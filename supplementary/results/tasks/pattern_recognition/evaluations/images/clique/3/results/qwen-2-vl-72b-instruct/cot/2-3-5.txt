   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct groups of nodes, each forming a clique. A clique is a group of nodes where each node is connected to every other node. In this graph, each group of five nodes is fully interconnected, meaning there are no isolated nodes within these groups, and each node is connected to all other nodes in its respective group. Therefore, there are three instances of cliques in the graph."
