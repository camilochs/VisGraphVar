  "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct clusters of nodes. Within each cluster, every node is directly connected to every other node in the same cluster. This complete interconnectedness within each group defines a 'clique.' There are three such clusters, thus three cliques. There are no connections between nodes in different clusters, distinguishing them as separate cliques."
