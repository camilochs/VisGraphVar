Here is the analysis of the graph image provided:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "Step 1: The graph contains several distinct clusters or groups of interconnected nodes.

Step 2: Upon closer inspection, each cluster consists of nodes that are fully interconnected with each other. Specifically, in each cluster, every node is linked to every other node within that cluster. This characteristic defines these clusters as 'cliques.'

Step 3: By counting these fully interconnected groups, there are three separate cliques visible in the graph.

Step 4: The reason for identifying these patterns as 'cliques' derives from the complete interconnection within each cluster. This structure is a hallmark of a clique in graph theory, where each node in a clique is connected to every other node in the same group."
}
```

Each cluster in the graph represents a clique. The presence of complete connectivity among each node within a cluster confirms the identification of these patterns as cliques.
