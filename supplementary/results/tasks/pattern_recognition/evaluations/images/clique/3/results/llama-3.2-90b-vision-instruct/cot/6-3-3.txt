Unfortunately, there is no image provided for analysis. However, based on the given steps and instructions, here's a sample JSON response:

```json
{
  "pattern": "chain",
  "number_of_patterns": 2,
  "analysis": "The graph consists of two distinct chains with three nodes each. Each chain has nodes that are interconnected in a continuous sequence, forming a linked pattern. The absence of isolated or peripheral nodes indicates that these chains are the dominant pattern in the graph."
}
```

This response assumes a hypothetical graph image that meets the specified pattern type and characteristics. To provide an accurate analysis, please provide the actual graph image.
