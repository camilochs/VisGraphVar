   "analysis": "There are three distinct groups of nodes in the graph. Each group forms a fully interconnected subgraph with no isolated nodes. The first group consists of nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3; the second group includes nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7; the third group consists of nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11. In each group, every node is directly connected to every other node, forming a 'clique'."
