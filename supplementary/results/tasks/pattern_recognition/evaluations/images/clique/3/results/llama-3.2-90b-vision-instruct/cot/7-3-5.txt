Unfortunately, the provided image of a graph could not be accessed. But I can offer a hypothetical response based on these steps:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [1],
   'analysis': 'If the majority of the distinct nodes in the image are heavily interconnected with the majority – or at least three – nodes, it is a clique because all the nodes are well connected.'
}
```
