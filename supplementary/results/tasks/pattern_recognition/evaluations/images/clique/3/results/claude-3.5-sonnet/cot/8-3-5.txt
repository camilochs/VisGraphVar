   "analysis": "The graph contains 3 distinct star patterns. Each pattern consists of a central node with 4 peripheral nodes connected to it. Specifically: 1) First star has node 1 as center with nodes 0,2,3,4 as peripherals. 2) Second star has node 6 as center with nodes 5,7,8,9 as peripherals. 3) Third star has node 11 as center with nodes 10,12,13,14 as peripherals. The nodes in each star pattern are arranged in a way where all peripheral nodes connect only to the central node, creating the characteristic star topology."
