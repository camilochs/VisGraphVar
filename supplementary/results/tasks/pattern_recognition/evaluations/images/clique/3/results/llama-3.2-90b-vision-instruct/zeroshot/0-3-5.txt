Based on the given image, I observe that there are three groups of nodes in the graph. Each group is a fully connected subgraph, where every node is connected to every other node within the group. There are no interconnections between the groups.

Given this structure, I can conclude that the pattern type in the graph is 'clique.' A clique is a subgraph in which every two distinct vertices are adjacent, i.e., every possible edge is present.

The number of patterns of this type that I detected is 3, since there are three separate groups of nodes in the graph that each form a clique.

The features in the graph that led me to this conclusion are the full connectivity of the nodes within each group and the absence of connections between the groups.

{
  'pattern': ['clique'],
  'number_of_patterns': [3],
  'analysis': 'The graph contains three fully connected subgraphs with no interconnections between them.'
}
