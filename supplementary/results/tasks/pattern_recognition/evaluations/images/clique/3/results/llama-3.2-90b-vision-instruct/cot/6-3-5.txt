To determine the pattern type in the graph image, we follow these steps:

1. **Observe the structure**: The graph consists of multiple clusters where nodes are grouped together. Each cluster has its own set of interconnected nodes.

2. **Identify distinct clusters, groups, or links**: Upon closer inspection, it's evident that each cluster forms a fully interconnected group where every node is connected to every other node within the same cluster. There are no isolated nodes within these clusters.

3. **Determine the pattern type**:
   - A 'chain' would imply connections between nodes in a sequence, which isn't present here.
   - A 'star' pattern would have a central node with direct connections to peripheral nodes, also not observed.
   - A 'clique,' however, fits perfectly as each cluster has all nodes interconnected without any isolated points.

4. **Count instances**: There are 3 distinct clusters or cliques observable in the graph.

**Answer**: 
```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "The graph image depicts clusters of nodes that are fully interconnected within each cluster. This arrangement is characteristic of a clique pattern, where every node within a cluster connects to every other node, with no isolated nodes or sequential connections observed across the entire graph. Hence, by observing the structure and the connectivity within each cluster, we conclude that the pattern type present in the graph is that of a clique."
