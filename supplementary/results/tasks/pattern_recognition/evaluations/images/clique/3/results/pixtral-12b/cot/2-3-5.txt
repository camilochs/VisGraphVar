Analyzing the provided graph image, we can identify the pattern types by following these steps:

1. **Observe the Structure**: The graph contains three distinct clusters of nodes. Each cluster appears to have nodes that are interconnected to each other.

2. **Determine Pattern Types**:
   - **Upper left cluster**: Includes the nodes {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. All these nodes are interconnected with each other.
   - **Lower left cluster**: Includes the nodes {10, 11, 12, 13, 14}. Similarly, these nodes are fully interconnected.
   - **Lower right cluster**: Includes the nodes {1, 2, 3, 4}. This cluster also has all the nodes interconnected.

3. **Count Instances**: We identified three clusters of nodes where each cluster forms a fully interconnected group.

4. **Explain Reasoning**:
   - Each cluster of nodes represents a 'clique,' where every node is connected to every other node within the same cluster.
   - There are no signs of a sequential 'chain' or a 'star' pattern with a central node, confirming that all nodes in each cluster are equivalent and fully connected to each other.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": [3],
   "analysis": "The graph displays three clusters of nodes, each fully interconnected, forming a 'clique' pattern. Each node within a cluster is connected to every other node in that cluster, without any central-peripheral distinctions. There is no sequential 'chain' or 'star' structure observed in any of the clusters."
