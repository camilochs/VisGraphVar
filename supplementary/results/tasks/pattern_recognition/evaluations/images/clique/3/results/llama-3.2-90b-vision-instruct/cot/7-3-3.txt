**Pattern Identification and Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the graph, we need to examine its structure and connections between nodes (represented as circles with numbers).

**Step 1: Observe Structure and Identify Clusters or Groups**

Looking at the graph, we can see three distinct groups or subgraphs:

- The first group consists of nodes 0, 1, and 2. These nodes are interconnected among themselves.
- The second group comprises nodes 3, 4, and 5. Similarly, these nodes form an interconnected cluster.
- The third group includes nodes 6, 7, and 8. They are also interconnected.

**Step 2: Determine Pattern Type**

Each group looks like a "clique" because all nodes within each group are directly connected to every other node in the same group. There are no isolated nodes or nodes that connect different groups in a star pattern.

**Step 3: Count Instances of Identified Pattern Type**

Since each cluster represents a clique (with all nodes interconnected), there are three instances of cliques in the graph.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the pattern type is 'clique', and there are three instances of this pattern in the graph.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'Three fully interconnected subgraphs (cliques) are observed in the graph, each consisting of three nodes directly connected to each other.'
}
