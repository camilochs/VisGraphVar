The graph image consists of three distinct groups of nodes:

* Group 1: nodes 0, 1, and 2
* Group 2: nodes 3, 4, and 5
* Group 3: nodes 6, 7, and 8

**Pattern Analysis**

Each group forms a **clique**, a fully connected subgraph where every node is connected to every other node. In a clique, each node shares an edge with every other node in the group. This means that:

* Nodes 0, 1, and 2 are all connected to each other (a clique)
* Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are all connected to each other (a clique)
* Nodes 6, 7, and 8 are all connected to each other (a clique)

**Conclusion**

Based on this analysis, the graph pattern is a "clique" with three clique patterns.
