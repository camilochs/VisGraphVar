To analyze the graph and identify the type of pattern it contains, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Observing the Structure**: The graph is composed of three separate groups of nodes (also known as vertices), each connected in a distinct way. These groups are isolated from one another, suggesting that there are no edges between any two groups.

2. **Identifying Patterns**:
   - A **chain** pattern would involve nodes connected in a linear sequence where each node (except the first and last) is connected to exactly two other nodes.
   - A **clique** pattern involves a subset of nodes where every node in this subset is connected to every other node, forming a complete subgraph.
   - A **star** pattern consists of a central node that is connected to all other nodes in the group, with none of the other nodes being directly connected to each other.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The top-left group consists of three nodes: 0, 1, and 2. Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 1 is connected to node 2, but there's no direct connection from node 0 to node 2. This doesn't fit a star or clique pattern but resembles a chain.
   - The bottom-left group contains nodes 3, 4, and 5, connected similarly to the first group, indicating another chain.
   - The bottom-right group consists of nodes 6, 7, and 8, also structured like a chain.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given the isolation and the linear connectivity within each group, we can conclude that all three structures represent **chain** patterns. Since there are three such patterns, the answer would be as follows:

```json
{
  'pattern': ['chain'],
  'number_of_patterns': 3,
  'analysis': 'Each group of nodes is linearly connected without direct connections between all nodes or a central node, fitting the definition of a chain.'
}
```
