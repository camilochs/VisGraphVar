The graph consists of three individual nodes connected by lines.

* Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3 but not enough to form a clique because not all nodes are interconnected.
* Node 4 is connected to both nodes 5 and 6.
* Node 8 is connected to nodes 9 and 10.

This type of pattern is characteristic of a "star," as each group of connections represents a star-like formation. Since there are multiple instances of this pattern in the graph, the answer is:
```json
{
   'pattern': "star",
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': "There are multiple instances of star patterns present, each with a central node connected to multiple surrounding nodes without forming a clique among them."
}
