Analyzing the graph image as per your instructions, I can identify a 'star' pattern formed around the nodes 11, 13, and 14. Following is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The existing links from the nodes 11, 13, and 14 to all their surrounding nodes resemble the central characteristic of a star pattern with a central node and peripheral nodes. This verifies why these nodes are identified as Star patterns.'
}
```

I have identified three 'star' patterns present in this graph image: one appears with nodes 11, 13, 14, and 12; and 10; another is formed by nodes 8, 7, and 5, 6, and 9; and the last is formed by nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. These formations appear to mimic a star pattern, which aligns with the node centralization features of this type of pattern.
