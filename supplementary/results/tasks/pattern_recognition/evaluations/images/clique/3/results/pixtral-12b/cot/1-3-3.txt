   "analysis": "Step 1: Observing the structure, there are three distinct clusters of interconnected nodes in the graph. 

     Step 2: Each cluster contains a central node with two or three other nodes connected to it. 

     Step 3: Counting the clusters, there are three separate subgroups that show a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes. This suggests a pattern where a single node acts as the hub while other nodes are connected to this hub node.

     Step 4: Given the arrangement and connections, the pattern type observed can be identified as a 'star' pattern. 

     Reason: Each cluster contains a central node that has direct links to other nodes without forming a continuous sequence or a fully interconnected set of nodes representing a 'chain' or 'clique' respectively."
