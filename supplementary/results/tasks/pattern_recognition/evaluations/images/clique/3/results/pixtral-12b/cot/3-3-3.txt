    - The top-left cluster has a central node (node 0) with three peripheral nodes (nodes 1 and 2 connected to node 0, and node 2 connected to node 1).
    - The bottom-left cluster has a central node (node 3) with three peripheral nodes (nodes 4 and 5 connected to node 3, and node 5 connected to node 4).
    - The bottom-right cluster has a central node (node 7) with three peripheral nodes (nodes 6 and 8 connected to node 7, and node 8 connected to node 6).

   These clusters show a central node that is connected to other peripheral nodes, conforming to the star pattern definition.'
