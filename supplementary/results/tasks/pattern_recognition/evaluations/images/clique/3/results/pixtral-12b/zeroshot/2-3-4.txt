   'analysis': 'The graph contains three distinct `star` patterns. Each `star` pattern consists of a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. The identified `star` patterns are: (1) the cluster of nodes with labels 9, 10, and 11, (2) the cluster of nodes with labels 0, 1, 2, and 3, and (3) the cluster of nodes with labels 4, 5, 6, and 7. These configurations align with the definition of a `star` pattern, where one central node connects directly to non-central nodes.'
