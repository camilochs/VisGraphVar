   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct clusters, where each cluster has three nodes that are fully interconnected with each other, forming a triangular shape. This indicates a clique pattern in each cluster. There are no isolated nodes, and the nodes within each cluster are connected, confirming the presence of a clique pattern. Therefore, the graph contains three instances of a clique pattern."
