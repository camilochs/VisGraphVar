To determine the pattern type in the graph image, we will follow the steps outlined:

1. **Identify Distinct Clusters or Links**: Looking at the graph, there are three distinct groups: one with nodes 0, 1, and 2; another with nodes 3, 4, and 5; and a third with nodes 6, 7, and 8.

2. **Determine Node Interconnection**: Each group consists of interconnected nodes. However, there are no direct connections between these groups, indicating they are not part of a larger interconnected structure like a chain or clique across the entire graph. Instead, within each group, all nodes are directly connected to each other, suggesting a clique structure for each group.

3. **Count Instances of Each Pattern**: Based on the observation that within each group, nodes are fully interconnected (like cliques), we count three instances of this pattern type.

4. **Explain Reasoning**: The graph visually depicts three isolated clusters where each node within a cluster is directly connected to the other nodes in the same cluster but not to any node in the other clusters. This intra-group full connectivity without any inter-group connections characterizes these as cliques.

**Final Answer**:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 3,
   "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct groups where all nodes within each group are directly connected to one another, fitting the definition of a clique. There are no inter-group connections, leading to the identification of three cliques in total."
}
