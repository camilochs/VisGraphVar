**Analysis of the Graph Pattern Type**

Based on the graph layout, we can determine the pattern type by observing how nodes are interconnected and grouped.

**Identifying Clusters and Interconnections**

1. Observe that the graph consists of three distinct clusters or groups.
2. Analyze the interconnections within each cluster:
	- Group 1 (nodes 8, 9, 10, 11): All nodes are interconnected directly or indirectly, forming a closed network without isolated nodes.
	- Group 2 (nodes 0, 1, 2, 3): Similar to Group 1, all nodes have direct or indirect connections with each other, indicating a fully interconnected structure.
	- Group 3 (nodes 4, 5, 6, 7): This group also exhibits direct or indirect connections between its nodes, signifying another highly connected cluster.

**Pattern Identification**

Given that all groups (clusters) display full interconnection without any isolated nodes, the observed pattern aligns with the definition of a 'clique'. A clique is characterized by its complete interconnectivity, where every node is directly connected to every other node within the group.

**Counting Instances of the Pattern**

Upon reviewing the graph, we identify:
- Three separate instances of fully interconnected groups (cliques).

**Conclusion**

The identified pattern type is a 'clique', with three instances of such fully interconnected groups observed in the graph.
