**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the given graph image, we need to analyze its structure.

**Relevant Data:**

* The graph consists of three separate clusters.
* Each cluster is a fully connected subgraph.

**Analysis:**

* A chain pattern would consist of nodes connected linearly, which is not observed here.
* A star pattern would have a central node connected to all other nodes, with no connections between them, which also doesn't match our graph.
* A clique pattern is characterized by every node being connected to every other node within a cluster, which fits the structure we see.

**Conclusion:**

Given the fully connected nature of each cluster within the graph, the pattern present in the graph image is a clique. Since there are three distinct fully connected clusters without any connections between them, we conclude the following:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The presence of fully connected subgraphs (where every node in the subgraph is connected to every other node) indicates a clique pattern. The existence of three such isolated cliques within the graph leads to our conclusion.'
}
