**Graph Pattern Analysis**

### Step 1: Understand possible graph patterns

The problem specifies three patterns to detect: 'chain,' 'clique,' and 'star'. These common graph patterns have the following definitions:

*   **chain**: A path where every node is connected to every other node via edges, resembling a chain or line.
*   **clique**: A subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two vertices in the clique are adjacent; that is, every pair of vertices in the clique are connected by an edge.
*   **star**: A tree with one internal node and all others being pendant vertices.

### Step 2: Analyze the graph

The provided graph has three clusters of nodes: (6,7,8), (3,4,5), and (0,1,2). Each cluster represents a fully connected subgraph, while each node within a cluster is connected to all other nodes in the same cluster. However, there are no edges connecting nodes from one cluster to another.

### Step 3: Determine the type of pattern

Based on the above observation, each cluster constitutes a clique pattern. Since there are three clusters, there are three clique patterns in the graph.

### Step 4: Summarize the findings

The graph contains three clique patterns, chains, and no star pattern.

**Conclusion:**

```json
{
    'pattern': 'clique',
    'number_of_patterns': 3,
    'analysis': 'Eacch cluster of nodes where every node is connected to every other node in the same cluster forms a clique pattern.'
}
```

**Answer:** The graph represents a clique pattern with respect to each sub-group of nodes. Hence, we have three clique patterns with no relationships between clusters.
