Based on the graph, I observe the following pattern:

```json
{
  'pattern': 'clique',
  'number_of_patterns': 3,
  'analysis': The graph displays three distinct groups of interconnected nodes, each forming a clique pattern. In each group, all nodes are directly connected to every other node within the same group. The groups are isolated from one another, with no connections between them. This indicates a strong, fully interconnected relationship among the nodes within each group, but no links or relationships between the groups themselves.
}
```

Conclusion:
The graph exhibits a clique pattern, featuring interconnected nodes within isolated groups, with no external connections between these groups.
