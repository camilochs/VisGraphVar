   "analysis": "The graph displays three clusters. Each cluster is structured such that one central node is connected to multiple peripheral nodes, which is characteristic of a 'star' pattern. Specifically: 

    1. The first cluster (top-left) has a central node with connections leading to nodes labeled 7, 6, 5, 8, and 9.
    2. The second cluster (top-right) has a central node with connections to nodes labeled 11, 10, 13, 12, and 14.
    3. The third cluster (bottom) has a central node with connections to nodes labeled 1, 3, 4, and 2.

    These clusters indicate a pattern where one node serves as the focus of connectivity for multiple surrounding nodes."
