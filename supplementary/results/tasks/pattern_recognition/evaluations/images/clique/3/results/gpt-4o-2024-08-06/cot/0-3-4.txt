   "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct clusters. Each cluster contains four nodes that are fully interconnected, forming a complete subgraph or 'clique'. There are no isolated nodes, and all nodes within each group are connected to each other without forming a sequence or having a central node with peripheral nodes. Therefore, the pattern type is identified as 'clique', and there are three instances of this pattern in the graph."
