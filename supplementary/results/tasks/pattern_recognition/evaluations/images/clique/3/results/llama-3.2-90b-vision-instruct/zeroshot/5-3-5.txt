**Graph Image Analysis**

**Step 1: Overview of the Graph Image**

To analyze the graph image and identify the type of pattern it contains, we need to carefully examine the nodes and edges present in the graph.

**Step 2: Identifying Possible Patterns**

The possible patterns we are looking for are:

*   Chain: Nodes linked linearly
*   Clique: Fully connected subgraph
*   Star: Shared center nodes branching out linearly

**Step 3: Analyzing the Graph**

Upon examining the graph image, we notice that only one of the three patterns presented is in the graph.

The graph image displays two sets of cliques and a separate clique. In a clique, all nodes are connected to every other node. In this case, the group of nodes with 6, 7, 8, 9, and 5 appears to demonstrate a clique pattern.

There is also a second set of cliques in the graph image. This set includes nodes numbered 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 and is located in the top-right corner of the image. 

Upon closer inspection, there is an additional clique consisting of three nodes numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the center is node 0 which is connected to the four surrounding nodes. Two of these four nodes are also connected to one another and the other two of the four are connected but not to the previously mentioned two, therefore demonstrating a separate clique.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the pattern present in the graph is a "clique." The total count of this pattern type found is 3.

**Result**

```json
{
  "pattern": "clique",
  "number_of_patterns": 3,
  "analysis": "The graph contains three distinct cliques, each consisting of a set of fully connected nodes. These cliques demonstrate the characteristic pattern of a clique."
