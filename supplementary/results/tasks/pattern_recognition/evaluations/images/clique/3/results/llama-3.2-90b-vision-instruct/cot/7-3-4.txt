**Pattern Analysis**

To identify the pattern type in the given graph, let's follow the steps:

### Observe the Structure

Looking at the graph, we see three separate clusters of interconnected nodes without a single continuous sequence across all clusters.

### Determine the Pattern Type

- **Chain**: A chain pattern would consist of nodes connected in a continuous sequence. However, there is no continuous chain encompassing all given nodes; thus, it is not a chain pattern.
- **Clique**: A clique represents complete interconnectivity among all nodes. While each cluster (on the top right, bottom right, and bottom left) individually shows complete interconnectivity among its respective nodes, they are isolated from each other. Therefore, this isn't a clique pattern across the entire graph.
- **Star**: A star pattern features a central node connected to surrounding peripheral nodes. Each cluster in the graph has a structure where one node is more central than others, suggesting a star-like connectivity within each cluster.

### Count Instances of Each Identified Pattern

Given the description, there are three instances that resemble stars more closely than chains or cliques when considering the entire graph's layout.

**Answer:**

```json
{
  'pattern': ['star'],
  'number_of_patterns': 3,
  'analysis': 'The graph shows three isolated clusters. Each cluster resembles a star pattern due to their interconnected yet distinct groupings. There isn\'t a single chain or clique encompassing the entire set of nodes.'
}
```
