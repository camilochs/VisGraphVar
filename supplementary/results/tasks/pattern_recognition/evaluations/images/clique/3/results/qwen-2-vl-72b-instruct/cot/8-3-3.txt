   "analysis": "The graph consists of three separate groups, each of which is a clique. Each group has three nodes, and each node is connected to the other two nodes within the group. There are no connections between nodes in different groups, indicating that we do not have a chain or star pattern. Therefore, the pattern type is a clique, and there are three instances of this pattern in the image."
