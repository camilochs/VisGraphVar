2. Each cluster contains three nodes, creating a triangular shape, which suggests that every node in a cluster is interconnected with each other.

3. The interconnected nature and central focus of these triangles indicate that each set can be identified as a 'star' pattern, where one node can be considered the central node (apex of the triangle) and the others are surrounding it.

4. There are no other kinds of patterns such as a continuous sequence or fully interconnected networks present in the graph.

5. Summarizing the identifies patterns, all clusters are star-shaped triangles."
