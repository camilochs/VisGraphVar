**Pattern Identification**

After carefully analyzing the graph image, I have identified the following pattern:

**Pattern:** clique

**Number of Patterns:** 3

**Analysis:**

Upon examining the graph, I notice that there are three distinct clusters or groups of nodes. Each cluster consists of a set of nodes that are fully interconnected with each other, meaning that every node in a cluster is connected to every other node in the same cluster.

*   The first cluster (top-left) contains nodes 6, 7, and 8, which are all connected to each other.
*   The second cluster (bottom-left) comprises nodes 3, 4, and 5, which are also fully interconnected.
*   The third cluster (right) consists of nodes 1, 2, and 0, which are similarly connected to each other.

Given this structure, where nodes within each cluster are fully connected without any isolated nodes, I conclude that the pattern exhibited by the graph is a "clique." A clique is a subgraph where every node is connected to every other node, and in this case, we have three separate cliques.

Therefore, the correct response in JSON format is:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'The graph exhibits a clique pattern, with three separate clusters where every node within a cluster is connected to every other node.'
}
```
