Based on the detailed analysis of the graph image, I have identified the pattern types and provided the relevant count and reasoning as requested.

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star', 'star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 2,
   'analysis': 'Upon observing the graph, I identified two distinct clusters representing the pattern types.

    1. In the first cluster (located in the top-left corner), the nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are closely interconnected. Nodes overlap substantially, indicating a clique-like pattern with no distinguishable central node.

    2. The second cluster consists of nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 located in the bottom-left corner. Similar to the first cluster, it does not present a clear central node, but rather overlapping connections indicating a clique-like structure.

    3. In the third cluster (located in the top-right corner), nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are closely interconnected with an apparent central node. Nodes are arranged in a circular manner indicating a central core (node) with surrounding peripheral nodes, characteristic of a star pattern.

    Thus, there are two defined star patterns in the provided graph image.'
