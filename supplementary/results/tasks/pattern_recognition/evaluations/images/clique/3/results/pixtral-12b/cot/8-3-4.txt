Analyzing the graph based on the provided steps:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.**
   - The graph contains three distinct groups of nodes, each grouped closely together.

2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').**
   - Each group of nodes appears to be fully interconnected without any isolated nodes. In other words, each node is connected to every other node in its group.

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.**
   - The graph contains exactly three 'cliques' (fully interconnected groups).

4. **Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes.**
   - The layout of the graph shows that each set of nodes (clusters) are all connected to each other without any missing connections within the group, which is a characteristic of a 'clique.' This structure is repeated three times in the image.

Therefore, the pattern that best describes this graph is 'clique.'
