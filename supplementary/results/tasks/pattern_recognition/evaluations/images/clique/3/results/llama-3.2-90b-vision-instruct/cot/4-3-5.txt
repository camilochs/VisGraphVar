**Pattern Analysis**

Following a structured approach to identifying patterns in the graph image:

* **Step 1: Observe the Structure**
	+ The graph is divided into three distinct groups or clusters.
	+ Each cluster consists of interconnected nodes, with no connections between these separate clusters.
* **Step 2: Identify Pattern Types**
	+ Each cluster forms a fully connected group of nodes.
	+ All nodes within a cluster are directly connected to every other node in the same cluster.
	+ There are no isolated nodes or nodes that only connect to a central node in these groups.
	+ Based on these observations, each cluster represents a "clique" pattern.
* **Step 3: Count Patterns**
	+ There are three distinct clusters visible in the graph image.
	+ Each of these clusters fits the description of a clique pattern.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph displays a total of three clique patterns, with each cluster representing a fully interconnected set of nodes without any isolated or peripheral nodes.
