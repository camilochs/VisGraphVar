   "analysis": "The graph shows three separate groups of nodes, where each group forms a clique pattern. In each group, every node is connected to every other node within that group, forming complete subgraphs. Specifically: 1) Nodes 6,7,8 form one clique where all three nodes are interconnected, 2) Nodes 0,1,2 form another clique with full interconnection, and 3) Nodes 3,4,5 form the third clique where each node connects to the others in its group. Each of these three structures meets the definition of a clique as they show complete interconnection between all nodes within their respective groups."
