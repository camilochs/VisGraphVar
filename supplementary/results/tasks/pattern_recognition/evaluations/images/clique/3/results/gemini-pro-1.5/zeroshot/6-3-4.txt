  "analysis": "The graph contains three 2-cliques (all pairs of nodes connected by edges) that are disconnected components. Specifically, nodes (0,1), (2,3), (4,7), (5,6), (8,9), (9,11), and (8,11), form cliques corresponding to each disconnected component of the graph. Although each pair of connected nodes forms a clique, we only consider maximal cliques such that no other clique can completely contain it. Therefore, we can form three 2-cliques from each disconnected component."
