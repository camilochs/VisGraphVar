Analysis of the Provided Graph Image

**Step 1: Identifying the Graph Structure**

The graph consists of nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between them. The nodes are labeled (denoted as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14), showing their identities and connections.

**Step 2: Determining Node Degrees**

We calculate the degrees of all nodes to analyze the relationships:

1. Node 0: connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 (degree = 4)
2. Node 1: connected to nodes 0 and 13 (degree = 2)
3. Node 2: connected to nodes 0 and 9 (degree = 2)
4. Node 3: connected to nodes 0 and 8 (degree = 2)
5. Node 4: connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7 (degree = 3)
6. Node 5: connected to nodes 4 and 6 (degree = 2)
7. Node 6: connected to node 5 (degree = 1)
8. Node 7: connected to nodes 4 and 6 (degree = 2)
9. Node 8: connected to nodes 3 and 9 (degree = 2)
10. Node 9: connected to nodes 2 and 8 (degree = 2)
11. Node 10: connected to nodes 11, 12, and 14 (degree = 3)
12. Node 11: connected to nodes 10 and 12 (degree = 2)
13. Node 12: connected to nodes 10 and 11 (degree = 2)
14. Node 13: connected to nodes 1 and 11 (degree = 2)
15. Node 14: connected to node 10 (degree = 1)

**Conclusion and Result**

Based on the analysis, we can determine the type of pattern present in the graph image.

```json
{
    "pattern": "star",
    "number_of_patterns": 2,
    "analysis": "Two nodes have connectivity patterns characteristic of star patterns, specifically nodes 0 and 10, as they are directly connected to multiple other nodes, creating centralized structures resembling stars."
}
```

The graph contains two **star patterns**, centered around nodes 0 and 10. The presence of multiple nodes connected directly to these central nodes identifies the star structure.

There are no **chain patterns** detected, as links between nodes are not sequential or exclusively linear.

Finally, there are also no **clique patterns**, as there are no fully interconnected groups of nodes where every node is connected to every other node.

The analysis reveals that the graph contains two star patterns, providing insights into its structure and connectivity.
