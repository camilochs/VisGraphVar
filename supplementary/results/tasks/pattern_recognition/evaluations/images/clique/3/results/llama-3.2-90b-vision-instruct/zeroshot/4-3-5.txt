To identify the type of pattern in the given graph image, we need to analyze its structure and characteristics. 

- **Chain Pattern**: A chain is a sequence of nodes where each node connects to the next one in a linear fashion. 
    In the provided image, there are no sequences where each node only connects directly to another single node in a linear fashion without connecting to other nodes outside this direct sequence.

- **Clique Pattern**: A clique is a subgraph where every node is connected to every other node. 
    Looking at the image, there are groups of nodes where every node within a group is connected to every other node in the same group. For example, the group with nodes labeled 6, 7, 5, 8, and 9 is fully interconnected, indicating a clique.

- **Star Pattern**: A star is a pattern where one central node connects to all other nodes, and those other nodes do not connect to each other. 
    In the given image, there isn't a clear central node that connects to all other nodes without those nodes having connections among themselves.

Based on the analysis, the graph contains cliques as identified by the fully interconnected subgraphs. There's no evidence of chain or star patterns given the descriptions and the structure of the graph.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [3],
   'analysis': 'The image features groups of fully interconnected nodes, which is the defining characteristic of a clique pattern. Some of these cliques overlap, sharing common nodes, but each represents a group where every node is connected to every other node within the group.'
}
