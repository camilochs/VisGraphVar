   "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters, each containing three nodes that are all interconnected. This indicates that each cluster is a 'clique' where every node is connected to every other node within the group. There are no isolated nodes or continuous sequences, reinforcing the identification of 'clique' as the pattern type."
