**Property to determine:** Pattern type (chain, clique, or star), number of occurrences, and analysis.

**Relevant data:**

* Graph structure: Five clusters of nodes.
* Cluster 1: Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
* Cluster 2: Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
* Cluster 3: Nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11.
* Cluster 4: Nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15.
* No central node connects all clusters.

**Analysis:**

Upon examining the graph, it is clear that each group of nodes represents a separate clique since every node within a group is directly connected to every other node in that same group. There are no chains or stars formed by connecting these groups. Each group operates independently without a central node linking the entire graph together. 

Therefore, the identified pattern is 'clique', with a total count of 4 cliques, as observed in the distinct clusters of interconnected nodes.

```json
{
    'pattern': ['clique'],
    'number_of_patterns': 4,
    'analysis': 'Four distinct groups of fully interconnected nodes, each constituting a clique pattern without any indication of a chain or star configuration across the graph.'
}
