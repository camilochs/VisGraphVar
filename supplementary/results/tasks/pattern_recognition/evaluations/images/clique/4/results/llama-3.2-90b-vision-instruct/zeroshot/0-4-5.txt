The graph image exhibits a pattern that can be identified by analyzing its structure and the connections between nodes.

**Pattern Type: Clique**

A clique is a subgraph where every node is connected to every other node. In the graph image, there are four clusters of nodes:
* Three clusters with three nodes
* One cluster with four nodes
Each node within a cluster is connected to every other node in that cluster. This characteristic aligns with the definition of a clique.

**Total Count of Patterns**

There are 4 patterns in the graph image that match this definition.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the pattern in the graph image is a clique, with a total count of 4 patterns.

*Answer*: 
```json
{
    'pattern': ['clique'],
    'number_of_patterns': 4,
    'analysis': 'The graph contains four subgraphs (technically complete subgraphs) where every node in a subgraph is connected to every other node, fitting the definition of a clique.'
