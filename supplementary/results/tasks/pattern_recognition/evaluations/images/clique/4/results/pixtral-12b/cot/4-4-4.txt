To analyze the provided graph image and identify the pattern types, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:**

   - There are several clusters in the graph: each cluster consists of 3 nodes grouped closely together.

2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star'):**

   - Each cluster of 3 nodes forms a triangle, which means all nodes in a cluster are fully interconnected. This pattern does not match a 'chain' because there is no sequential connection.
   - It does not meet the criteria for a 'star' pattern because there is no central node with peripheral nodes; instead, each node is connected to the other two nodes in the cluster.
   - This pattern matches a 'clique' where all nodes are mutually connected.

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:**

   - There are four distinct clusters of triangles, each forming a 'clique.'

4. **Explain the reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes:**

   - Each triangle in the graph represents a 'clique.' In graph theory, a clique is a subset of nodes in a graph where every two distinct nodes are connected to each other by an edge. Here, each set of 3 nodes in a triangle is fully interconnected, forming a dense cluster with no node isolated or-loosely connected.
   - No pattern other than 'cliques' of three is observed as per the rules of cliques where fully connected groups only form triangles due to the odd number squeezed inside minimal clustering configuration.

### Conclusion:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 4,
   "analysis": "Each cluster consists of 3 interconnected nodes forming a 'clique'. The unions are isolated, producing distinct maximum connectivity within the said clusters."
