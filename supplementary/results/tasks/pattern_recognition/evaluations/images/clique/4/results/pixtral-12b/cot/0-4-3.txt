   "analysis": "1. Each group of nodes in the graph is fully interconnected without any nodes being isolated. This indicates that each node within a cluster is linked directly with every other node within the same cluster.\n2. There are four distinct clusters in the graph, each containing three interlinked nodes.\n3. The clusters are not interconnected with each other, meaning they form separate cliques. Hence, the pattern type for the entire graph is identified as cliques."
