**Pattern Description**

The graph image contains three distinct patterns. These patterns are characterized as follows:

* **Pattern 1**: Chain
	+ Nodes: 7, 8, and 6
	+ Description: This chain is a linear sequence of connected nodes.
* **Pattern 2 and 3**: Clique
	+ Nodes: 3, 4, and 5 (Pattern 2); 9, 10, and 11 (Pattern 3)
	+ Description: These cliques feature multiple nodes with connections to every other node within the group.

Overall, the key patterns in the graph image are chains and cliques.
