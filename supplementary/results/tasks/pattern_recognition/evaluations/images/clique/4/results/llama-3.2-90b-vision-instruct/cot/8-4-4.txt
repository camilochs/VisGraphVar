**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

**Step 1: Identify Distinct Clusters or Groups**

Upon analyzing the graph, four distinct clusters are observed. Each cluster consists of multiple nodes connected to each other.

**Step 2: Determine the Pattern Type**

*   **Chain:** The pattern type chain is characterized by nodes interconnected in a continuous sequence. However, this pattern is not present in the graph since the nodes within each cluster are not sequentially connected.
*   **Clique:** A clique pattern involves all nodes being fully interconnected without any isolated nodes. Although the nodes within each cluster are interconnected, they do not form a complete graph where every node is connected to every other node across all clusters. Therefore, this pattern is also not applicable.
*   **Star:** A star pattern features a central node surrounded by peripheral nodes. In the given graph, each cluster has a central node from which links extend to the peripheral nodes, thereby forming a star pattern.

**Step 3: Count Instances of the Identified Pattern**

Four instances of the star pattern are identified in the graph, each corresponding to one of the four clusters.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph exhibits a star pattern. This conclusion is derived from the presence of central nodes in each cluster, with links radiating outward to the peripheral nodes, characteristic of a star pattern.
