  "analysis": "The graph consists of three distinct clusters of nodes. Within each cluster, every node is connected to every other node in the same cluster.  This fully interconnected characteristic defines a clique. There are no connections between nodes in different clusters.  There are three such fully-connected clusters, thus identifying three separate cliques."
