The graph image consists of four distinct groups of nodes, each representing a different pattern.

**Pattern 1: Clique (Nodes 10, 9, and 11)**
* Each node is directly connected to the other two.
* This satisfies the definition of a clique, where all nodes are interconnected.

**Pattern 2: Clique (Nodes 3, 4, and 5)**
* Similar to Pattern 1, these nodes are fully interconnected.

**Pattern 3: Clique (Nodes 6, 7, and 8)**
* Another instance of a clique, as each node is connected to the others.

**Pattern 4: Clique (Nodes 0, 2, and 1)**
* A fourth clique is observed in this graph.

**Conclusion**
The graph consists of four cliques, each comprising three nodes that are fully interconnected.
