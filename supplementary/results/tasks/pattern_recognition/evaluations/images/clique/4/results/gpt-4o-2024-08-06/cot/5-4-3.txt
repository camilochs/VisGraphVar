   "analysis": "The graph contains four distinct groups of nodes. Each group consists of three nodes where every node is connected to the other two, forming a fully interconnected subgraph, known as a 'clique'. There are no isolated nodes or central nodes with peripheral nodes (star pattern). Thus, there are four instances of the clique pattern in the graph."
