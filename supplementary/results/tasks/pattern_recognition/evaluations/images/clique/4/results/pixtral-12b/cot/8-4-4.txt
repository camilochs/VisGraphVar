Based on analyzing the graph image provided, here is the detailed identification and explanation of the pattern types:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis':[
        {
            "Reasoning": "To identify patterns, observe the structure of connections between nodes in the graph.",
            "First cluster": {
                "Nodes": [0, 1, 2, 3],
                "Pattern": "Star",
                "Reason": "Node 0 is the central node connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3."
            },
            "Second cluster": {
                "Nodes": [4, 5, 6, 7],
                "Pattern": "Star",
                "Reason": "Node 5 is the central node connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7."
            },
            "Third cluster": {
                "Nodes": [8, 9, 10, 11],
                "Pattern": "Star",
                "Reason": "Node 9 is the central node connected to nodes 8, 10, and 11."
            },
            "Fourth cluster": {
                "Nodes": [12, 13, 14, 15],
                "Pattern": "Star",
                "Reason": "Node 13 is the central node connected to nodes 12, 14, and 15."
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
Explanation Steps:
1. **First Cluster**: The nodes [0, 1, 2, 3] are connected with node 0 at the center. Hence, it is identified as a "Star" pattern.
2. **Second Cluster**: The nodes [4, 5, 6, 7] are connected with node 5 at the center. Hence, it is identified as a "Star" pattern.
3. **Third Cluster**: The nodes [8, 9, 10, 11] are connected with node 9 at the center. Hence, it is identified as a "Star" pattern.
4. **Fourth Cluster**: The nodes [12, 13, 14, 15] are connected with node 13 at the center. Hence, it is identified as a "Star" pattern.

By examining each cluster separately and identifying the central and peripheral nodes, it is clear that all the clusters follow the same "Star" pattern.
