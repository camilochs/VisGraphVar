   "analysis": "The graph contains four distinct clusters where every node within a cluster is connected to every other node, forming cliques. These clusters can be identified as sets of interconnected nodes: {1, 10, 12, 13, 14}, {2, 3, 4}, {6, 7, 8, 9}, and {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. Each set is fully interconnected, indicating that there are no isolated nodes within each group, confirming the 'clique' pattern."
