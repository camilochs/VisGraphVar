   "analysis": "The graph shows four distinct clusters. Each cluster contains four nodes that are fully interconnected with each other, indicating a 'clique' pattern. There are no isolated nodes or nodes that form a 'chain' or 'star' pattern. The clusters are: (0, 1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6, 7), (8, 9, 10, 11), and (12, 13, 14, 15). Each of these groups forms a separate complete graph."
