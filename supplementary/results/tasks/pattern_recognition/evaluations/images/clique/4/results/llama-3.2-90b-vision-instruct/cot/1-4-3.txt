**Pattern Analysis**

To identify the pattern type in the graph, let's follow the steps outlined.

**Step 1: Observe Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters**

Looking at the graph, we can see several clusters or groups of nodes that are closely linked. These clusters do not form a continuous sequence (chain) or a fully interconnected group without isolated nodes (clique). Instead, there appears to be a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes in each cluster.

**Step 2: Determine Pattern Type**

Based on the observation, the clusters resemble stars, where one node acts as the central or hub node connected directly to other peripheral nodes.

**Step 3: Count Instances of Each Identified Pattern**

Upon closer inspection, we can count a total of 4 such star-like clusters in the graph.

**Conclusion**

Therefore, the pattern type identified in the graph is 'star,' with a total of 4 instances observed.

**Answer in JSON Format**

```json
{
  "pattern": ["star"],
  "number_of_patterns": 4,
  "analysis": "The graph consists of multiple distinct clusters that resemble stars. Each cluster has a central node that connects directly to peripheral nodes. By counting these star-like formations, we find a total of 4 instances across the graph, leading us to conclude that the pattern type is indeed 'star'."
