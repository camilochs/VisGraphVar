    1. Identify distinct clusters in the graph: This graph contains four unique clusters, each arranged as a center node surrounded by additional nodes.

    2. Determine the connectivity of the nodes: The identified clusters have a central node with other nodes connected around it, confirming the "star" pattern. Each star formation consists of one central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes.

    3. Count the instances of each identified pattern: There are four distinct clusters, each representing one "star" pattern.

    4. Final reasoning: The nodes within each cluster are connected such that each has a central node with multiple peripheral nodes connecting back to it, thus forming star patterns.'
