The graph at hand contains 4 groups of numbers appearing to overlap one another. Each cluster composes multiple smaller circles, each containing a unique number. For example, cluster 2 contains objects 4, 7, and 10; Cluster 3 contains objects 1, 2, and 3.



**conclusion:**

Based on my findings, I discovered that the graph contains 4 instances of the 'clique' pattern, in the form of small cluster groups. This analysis can be expressed in JSON as below:

```
{
  'pattern': 'clique',
  'number_of_patterns': 4,
  'analysis': 'The 4 groups of overlapping circles each containing unique numbers visually and mathematically correspond to the definition of a clique pattern. This conclusion can be explained in terms of undirected and unweighted graphs, each node is said to be connected to each other.'
 }

```

The final answer is: `0`
