**Answer:** 

```json 
{
   'pattern': 'star',
   'number_of_patterns': 1,
   'analysis': 'A star pattern is identified by a central node that is linked to several peripheral nodes with no or extremely weak connectivity among them. The given picture shows a graph with a central point 14 connected to numerous points 12, 13, and 15. There are no connections between points 12, 13, or 15. This shows a star pattern since point 14 is the only central point linked to all others, while point 15 and point 12 are not connected.'
}
```

To find the solution for this question, we need to analyze the given graph image:

1.  **Identify the central node**: Look for a node that has a significantly higher degree (number of edges) than the other nodes.

2.  **Check connectivity between peripheral nodes**: Verify if the nodes connected to the central node have any connections between them.

The graph image is described as having a node "14" connected to several other nodes ("12", "13", and "15"), and there are no connections between these peripheral nodes. 

This matches the definition of a star pattern, where a central node is connected to multiple peripheral nodes that do not have any connections among themselves.

Therefore, the correct answer is a star pattern with one instance found in the graph.
