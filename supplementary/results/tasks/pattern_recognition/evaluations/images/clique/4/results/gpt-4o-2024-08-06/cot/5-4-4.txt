   "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct groups, each forming a clique. A clique is characterized by every node being interconnected with every other node within the same group. In this image, nodes 0-3 form a clique, nodes 4-7 form another clique, nodes 8-11 form a third clique, and nodes 12-15 form the fourth clique. Each group has no isolated nodes and all are fully connected internally without external connections, which confirms the presence of cliques."
