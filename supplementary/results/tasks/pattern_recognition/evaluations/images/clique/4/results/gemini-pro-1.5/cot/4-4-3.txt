  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct, fully connected subgraphs. Each subgraph forms a clique because every node within each subgraph is connected to every other node in that same subgraph. These cliques are disconnected from each other, resulting in four separate clique patterns. Specifically, nodes {9, 10, 11} form one clique, nodes {0, 1, 2} form another, nodes {3, 4, 5} form a third, and nodes {6, 7, 8} form the fourth clique."
