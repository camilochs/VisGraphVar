Each cluster is composed of three interconnected nodes.\nStep 2: Determine the pattern type by checking the interrelationships.\nEach node set appears fully interconnected, forming a 'clique' where each node connects to every other node in its group.\nStep 3: Count the instances of the identified pattern (cliques). There are four distinct groups of three interconnected nodes.\nStep 4: Explanation.\nThe layout of each cluster represents a fully interconnected group ('clique') since each node is connected to every other node in the same subset."
