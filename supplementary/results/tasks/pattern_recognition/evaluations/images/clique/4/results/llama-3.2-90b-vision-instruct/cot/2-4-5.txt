**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we need to identify distinct clusters, groups, or links and analyze their interconnections.

**Step 1: Identify Distinct Clusters or Groups**

Upon examining the graph, we observe four distinct clusters of nodes:

* Cluster 1 (top): Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 form a group.
* Cluster 2 (right): Nodes 1, 4, 3, and 2 form a group.
* Cluster 3 (bottom): Nodes 15, 19, 16, 17, and 18 form a group.
* Cluster 4 (left): Nodes 6, 7, 9, and 8 form a group.

**Step 2: Analyze Interconnections Within Each Cluster**

Each cluster exhibits a property where every node is directly connected to every other node within the cluster. There are no isolated nodes within any cluster, and all nodes within a cluster are fully interconnected.

**Step 3: Determine the Pattern Type**

Based on the observation that each cluster has all its nodes fully interconnected without any isolated nodes, we can conclude that each cluster represents a "clique" pattern.

**Step 4: Count Instances of the Identified Pattern**

There are four instances of the clique pattern in the graph, corresponding to the four identified clusters.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the graph image primarily features the "clique" pattern, with four such instances. The analysis reveals that each cluster consists of nodes that are fully interconnected, characteristic of a clique.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': 'Each cluster in the graph represents a clique due to full interconnection among its nodes without any isolated nodes.'
}
