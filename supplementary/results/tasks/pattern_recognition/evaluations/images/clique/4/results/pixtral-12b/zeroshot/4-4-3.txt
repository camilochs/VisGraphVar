   "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct subgraphs, each exhibiting a star pattern. A star pattern is characterized by a central node connected to multiple peripherally located nodes. Here, each subgraph has a central node (e.g., 10, 5, 1, 6) connected to three peripheral nodes (e.g., 9, 11, 3, 4, 2, 7, 8). No other structural patterns, such as chains or cliques, are present."
