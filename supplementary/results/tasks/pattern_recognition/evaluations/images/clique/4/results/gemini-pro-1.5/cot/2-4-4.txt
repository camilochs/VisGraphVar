  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters of nodes. Within each cluster, every node is connected to every other node in that same cluster. There are no connections between nodes in different clusters.  This fully interconnected characteristic within each cluster defines a 'clique.' Since there are four such clusters, there are four cliques."
