  "analysis": "The image displays four distinct clusters of interconnected circles (nodes). The nodes within each cluster form a clique because every node is directly connected to every other node within the same cluster. There are no isolated nodes within each cluster. There are no connections between any of these clusters. Thus, there are a total of four cliques."
