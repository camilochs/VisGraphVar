   "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct groups of nodes. Each group contains three nodes that are fully interconnected, forming cliques. No nodes are isolated and none of the groups form a chain or a star pattern. The groups are: (0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), and (9, 10, 11). Each group fulfills the condition of a clique, where every pair of nodes within the group is connected by an edge."
