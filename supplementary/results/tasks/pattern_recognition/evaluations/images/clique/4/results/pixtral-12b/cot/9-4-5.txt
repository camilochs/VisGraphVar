   "analysis": "The graph consists of four separate clusters, each forming a central node with surrounding nodes connected to it. This specific arrangement resembles a 'star' pattern. This pattern is characterized by a central node that has multiple branches or peripheral nodes attached to it. Each cluster in the graph adheres to this structure, which led to the identification of the pattern."
