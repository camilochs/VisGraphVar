The graph image presents a complex network structure, comprising multiple interconnected nodes. Careful examination reveals that the graph can be divided into distinct subgraphs, each exhibiting unique topological characteristics.

Analyzing the nodes and their connections reveals the presence of two distinct cliques:

* Clique 1: Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
* Clique 2: Node 11 is connected to nodes 9 and 10.

These strongly cohesive subgraphs are characterized by mutual connections between all nodes, forming dense structures. The remaining nodes (0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8) do not exhibit any strong connections, instead being dispersed throughout the graph.

In summary, the graph image contains two cliques, with no evidence of chains or stars.
