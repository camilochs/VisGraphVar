   "analysis": "1. The graph presents four distinct groups of nodes. 
2. Each group consists of three nodes, with one central node connected to two peripheral nodes.
3. The central node in each group is linked directly to the two peripheral nodes.
4. The peripheral nodes are not connected to each other outside their respective groups.

Thus, based on these observations, the pattern observed in the graph is a 'star' pattern, where each central node is connected to two peripheral nodes, forming clusters of three nodes in total."
