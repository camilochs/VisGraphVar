**Pattern Analysis**

To accurately identify the type of pattern in the graph image, it is essential to examine the connections between the nodes.

* Without access to the graph image, we cannot perform an analysis to determine the type of pattern present.
* However, based on the requested JSON format, a typical response might look like this:

```json
{
    'pattern': 'chain',
    'number_of_patterns': 1,
    'analysis': 'The graph image contains a chain pattern, characterized by a sequence of nodes connected in a linear fashion.'
}
```

**Conclusion**

The actual response would depend on the details of the graph image when it is made available.
