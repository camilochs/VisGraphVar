**Pattern Identification Analysis**

To identify the pattern type in the given graph, we follow the outlined steps:

1. **Observation of Structure**: The graph consists of several clusters with varying numbers of nodes. These clusters are separate from each other.
2. **Determination of Pattern Type**: Upon closer inspection, each cluster seems to represent a circular arrangement where the distance between any two nodes is the same throughout the cluster, with no isolated nodes and no central node directly connecting to peripheral nodes.
3. **Counting Instances of Each Pattern**: There are 4 distinct clusters observed in the graph.

**Conclusion**

Given the circular arrangement without a central node or isolated nodes, and considering the evenly spaced connections within each cluster, the pattern type can be identified as a 'clique' for each cluster.

**Final Answer**

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of distinct circular clusters with no central or isolated nodes, indicating a clique pattern for each cluster present.'
}
```

This analysis concludes that the graph features 4 instances of the 'clique' pattern, characterized by their circular structure with evenly spaced nodes and no isolated or central nodes.
