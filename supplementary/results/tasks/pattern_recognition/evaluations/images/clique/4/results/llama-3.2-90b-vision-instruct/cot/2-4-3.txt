**Answer:**

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 5,
   'analysis': 'Upon examining the graph, we observe distinct clusters of multi-digit nodes linked together. These interconnected clusters do not exhibit a continuous sequence, forming a chain, but rather each node within the cluster is fully interconnected with its peers, indicating a clique pattern. Furthermore, none of these clusters feature a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes, ruling out the star pattern. As a result, we identify each multi-digit group as a separate clique, leading to a total of 5 cliques present in the graph.'
}
```

**Explanation:**

The provided graph illustrates 5 isolated groups of nodes, none of which are interconnected with each other. Each group, however, consists of multiple nodes that are interconnected. For instance, one group comprises the nodes 0, 1, and 2, while another consists of exclusively single-digit node 3. A notable exception is the cluster formed by nodes 7, 8, and 6, which are interconnected. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the identified pattern type is indeed 'clique,' with a total of 5 cliques present in the graph.
