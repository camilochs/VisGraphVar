   "analysis": "The graph contains four distinct clusters of nodes. Each cluster has every node fully interconnected, forming complete subgraphs known as cliques. There are no isolated nodes and each node within a cluster is connected to every other node in that cluster. The clusters are clearly separated with no links between nodes of different clusters. Thus, each distinct group forms a 'clique,' and there are four such cliques in total."
