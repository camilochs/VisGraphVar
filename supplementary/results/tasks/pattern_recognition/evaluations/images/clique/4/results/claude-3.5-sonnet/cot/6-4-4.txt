   "analysis": "The graph shows 4 distinct clique patterns. Each cluster contains fully interconnected nodes where every node is connected to every other node within its group. Specifically: 1) A clique of nodes 12-15 at the top, 2) A clique of nodes 4-7 on the right, 3) A clique of nodes 9-11 on the left, and 4) A clique of nodes 1-3 at the bottom center. In each cluster, all nodes are connected to each other, forming complete subgraphs, which is the defining characteristic of a clique pattern."
