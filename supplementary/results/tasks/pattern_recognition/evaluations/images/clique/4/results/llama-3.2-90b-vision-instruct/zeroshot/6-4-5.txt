**Pattern Identification**

To identify the pattern in the given graph image, we will analyze its structure and features.

**Relevant Elements:**

* Nodes (circles) labeled with numbers
* Edges (lines) connecting some nodes

**Observations:**

* There are no chains of nodes with each node connected to only two others.
* Some groups of nodes are fully interconnected, forming cliques.
* No central node connects directly to all other nodes, which is characteristic of a star pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Based on these observations, the pattern type in the graph is a **Clique**. The graph contains multiple fully interconnected node groups, which meet the definition of a clique. There is no evidence of chain or star patterns in the graph.

**Answer:** 

```json
{
  "pattern": ["clique"],
  "number_of_patterns": 4,
  "analysis": "The graph contains multiple cliques, meeting the criteria of all nodes being fully connected within each group. No chain or star patterns are present."
}
