   "analysis": "The graph contains four distinct groups of nodes. Each group is fully interconnected, meaning every node in a group is connected to every other node in that same group. This forms a 'clique' pattern. There are no isolated nodes or central nodes with peripheral nodes, and no continuous sequence indicating a 'chain.' Therefore, the pattern observed is 'clique,' and there are four such cliques present in the graph."
