  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters of nodes. Within each cluster, every node is connected to every other node in that same cluster, forming a clique. These cliques are isolated from each other, with no connections between clusters.  Specifically, we see cliques of size 5 formed by nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, {10, 11, 12, 13, 14} and {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. Therefore, the total number of clique patterns is 4."
