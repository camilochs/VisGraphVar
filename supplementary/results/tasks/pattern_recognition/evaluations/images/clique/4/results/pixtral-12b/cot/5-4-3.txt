Analyzing the given graph image, we can identify the pattern types and explain the reasoning as follows:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links:** The graph is visually divided into four separate groups of interconnected nodes.
2. **Determine the pattern type:**
   - All groups of nodes are fully interconnected without any isolated nodes.
   - This indicates that the pattern type for each group is a 'clique.' 
3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph:** There are four distinct cliques in the graph.
4. **Explanation:** Each clique consists of three nodes that are fully interconnected. In graph theory, a clique is a subset of nodes in a graph such that every two distinct nodes in the subset are connected by a direct link.

Following is the JSON formatted response:

```json
{
   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": [4],
   "analysis": "To determine the pattern type, we observe that each group of nodes in the graph is fully interconnected without any nodes being isolated. This structure is identified as a 'clique,' where each subset of nodes is directly linked to every other node in the subset. The graph contains four such cliques."
}
