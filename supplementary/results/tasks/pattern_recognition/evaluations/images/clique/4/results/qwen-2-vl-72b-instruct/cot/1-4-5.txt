   "analysis": "The graph contains five distinct clusters where nodes are fully interconnected. Each cluster forms a 'clique' as there are no isolated nodes and every node is connected to every other node within the cluster. There are no instances of 'chain' patterns where nodes form a continuous sequence, nor are there 'star' patterns with a central node and peripheral nodes. Therefore, the identified pattern is 'clique'."
