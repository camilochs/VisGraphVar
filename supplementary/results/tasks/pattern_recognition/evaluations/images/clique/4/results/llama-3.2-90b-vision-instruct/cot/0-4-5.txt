The graph image displays a set of interconnected nodes organized into clusters. Upon closer examination, we can see four distinct clusters of nodes, each of which is fully interconnected within itself. There are no connections between different clusters.

There are no isolated nodes, and there is no central node that connects all other nodes. Instead, each cluster forms a small interconnected group of nodes.

This pattern matches the definition of a 'clique' in graph theory, where every node in the graph is directly connected to every other node.

Based on this analysis, the final answer is:

{ 'pattern': 'clique', 'number_of_patterns': 4, 'analysis': 'The clusters of interconnected nodes in the image form four distinct cliques.' }
