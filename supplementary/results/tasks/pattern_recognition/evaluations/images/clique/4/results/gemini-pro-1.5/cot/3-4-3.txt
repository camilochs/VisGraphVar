  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters of nodes. Within each cluster, every node is directly connected to every other node in that same cluster. This complete interconnection within each subset of nodes defines a 'clique.' There are four such completely connected clusters, hence four cliques. There are no connections between these clusters; thus, they remain isolated clique patterns."
