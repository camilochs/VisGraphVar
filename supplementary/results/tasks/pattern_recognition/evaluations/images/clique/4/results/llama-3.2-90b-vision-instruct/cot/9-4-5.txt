**Analysis of the Pattern Type in the Graph**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we will follow the steps outlined:

**Step 1: Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters or Links**

Upon examining the graph, it is apparent that there are several distinct clusters with varying numbers of nodes within each cluster. The nodes within these clusters are fully interconnected without any isolated nodes. This observation is crucial for identifying the pattern type.

**Step 2: Determine the Pattern Type**

Based on the observation from Step 1, the clusters in the graph exhibit characteristics of a 'clique.' In graph theory, a clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two vertices in the subset are adjacent; that is, for every two vertices, there exists an edge connecting them. Given that all nodes within each cluster are interconnected, this aligns with the definition of a clique.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Each Identified Pattern**

There are four clusters identified in the graph. Each cluster meets the criteria for a clique due to the interconnectedness of their nodes.

**Conclusion**

Given the observations and analysis, the pattern type in the graph is identified as 'clique,' with a total count of 4 instances of this pattern type present in the image.

  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters where all nodes within each cluster are interconnected. This meets the definition of a clique in graph theory, where every two vertices in the subset are adjacent. Therefore, the identified pattern type is 'clique,' occurring 4 times in the graph."
