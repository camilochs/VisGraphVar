**Pattern Identification:**

*   Upon observing the graph, distinct clusters are identified.
*   The structure does not resemble a continuous sequence characteristic of a 'chain' or a 'star' with a central node and surrounding nodes.
*   Each cluster consists of fully interconnected nodes without any isolated nodes, indicating a 'clique' pattern for each cluster.

**Counting Instances:**

*   There are five distinct clusters in the graph.
*   Each cluster represents an instance of the 'clique' pattern.

**Analysis:**

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': 5,
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of five clusters, where each cluster contains nodes that are fully interconnected with each other, devoid of isolated nodes. This characteristic is definitive of a "clique" in graph theory. Hence, the identified pattern is a "clique," and there are five instances of this pattern present in the given graph structure.'
}
```

This analysis accurately identifies and counts the clique patterns within the graph structure based on the interconnected nature of the nodes within each cluster.
