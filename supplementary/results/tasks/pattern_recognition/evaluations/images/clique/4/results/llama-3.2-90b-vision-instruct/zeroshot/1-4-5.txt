**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the graph, let's analyze its structure:

*   The graph consists of four clusters of nodes.
*   Each cluster contains 4 nodes with exclusive connections to other nodes within their respective group, and there are no connections between nodes across different groups.
*   This characteristic rules out the possibility of a "star" or "chain" pattern since these would require at least some connection between distinct groups.

Given these observations, the graph displays a pattern known as a "clique" due to the presence of fully connected subgraphs (where every node is connected to every other node within the subgraph), and there are multiple such cliques present.

**Answer:**

```json
{
  "pattern": ["clique"],
  "number_of_patterns": 4,
  "analysis": "Each cluster forms a fully connected subgraph where every node is connected to every other node within the cluster, with no connections between clusters. This matches the definition of a clique pattern, and there are four such patterns in the graph."
}
```
