**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the pattern type in the graph, we need to examine its structure.

**Relevant Data:**

* The graph contains multiple clusters of vertices.
* Each cluster has a varying number of vertices connected to each other.
* There are no isolated vertices or edges outside these clusters.

**Solution:**

Considering the characteristics of the given graph:

* A **chain** pattern would involve a sequence of vertices connected in a linear fashion, which is not evident here.
* A **clique** is characterized by every vertex being directly connected to every other vertex within the group, forming a fully connected subgraph. This description matches some of the clusters in the graph.
* A **star** pattern involves a central vertex connected to all other vertices, but not necessarily those vertices connecting to each other. This isn't a dominant feature in the depicted clusters.

Given these definitions, the graph primarily consists of cliques, as it displays clusters where all vertices within those clusters are interconnected.

```json
{
   'pattern': ['clique'],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': 'The graph exhibits clusters where every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex within the cluster, fitting the definition of a clique. These fully connected subgraphs are the primary pattern observed.'
}
```

This analysis concludes that the graph contains four clusters that are best described as cliques, based on their connectivity.
