   "analysis": "In this graph, there are four distinct triangular cliques where each node is connected to all other nodes within its group. The cliques are: (0,1,2), (3,4,5), (6,7,8), and (9,10,11). Each clique consists of three nodes with every node directly connected to the other two nodes in its group, forming a complete subgraph. These structures are clearly separated from each other in the layout, making them easily identifiable as independent cliques. The defining characteristic of a clique pattern is that every node is connected to every other node in the group, which is exactly what we observe in each of these triangular formations."
