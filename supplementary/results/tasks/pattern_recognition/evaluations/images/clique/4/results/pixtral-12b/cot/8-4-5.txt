   'analysis': '1. The graph consists of four distinct clusters of nodes. \
                2. Nodes within each cluster are fully interconnected, forming a complete subgraph \
                    where every node is connected to every other node within the cluster. \
                3. This criteria matches the definition of a "clique" where all nodes are \
                    directly connected without any missing links between them. \
                4. There are four such fully interconnected clusters visible in the image. \
                5. This rules out "chain" and "star" patterns as no node sequences or central-node structures \
                    are observed.'
