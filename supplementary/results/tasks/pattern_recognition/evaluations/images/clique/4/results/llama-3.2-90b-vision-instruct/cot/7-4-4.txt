After analyzing the image, here is the data you requested:

```json
{
  'pattern': 'clique',
  'number_of_patterns': 4,
  'analysis': 'The image shows four clusters of interconnected nodes, with each cluster having multiple connections between its members. Each cluster represents a clique pattern, where every node is connected to every other node within that cluster.'
}
```

In this analysis, the image depicts a graph with four distinct clusters. Each cluster consists of nodes that are all interconnected with each other, forming a clique pattern. This is evident from the dense connections within each cluster, where every node is linked to every other node. The presence of four such clusters indicates that there are four instances of the clique pattern in the image.
