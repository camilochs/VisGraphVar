**Pattern Analysis**

To analyze the pattern in the graph, follow these steps:

* **Step 1: Identifying Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**
	+ Observe the structure to identify distinct clusters, groups, or links.
	+ The graph consists of several small clusters of interconnected nodes.
* **Step 2: Determining the Pattern Type**
	+ Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star').
	+ Most clusters consist of three interconnected nodes, with one cluster containing four nodes.
	+ The presence of interconnected nodes without a chain or star structure indicates that some clusters resemble cliques.
* **Step 3: Counting Instances of Each Identified Pattern**
	+ Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph.
	+ There are four clusters in total: three that resemble cliques and one with four interconnected nodes.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the pattern type in the graph is a 'clique,' with a total of four instances of this pattern type appearing in the image.
