   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 separate clique patterns. Each clique consists of 4 nodes where every node is connected to every other node in its group. These can be seen in the groups (0,1,2,3), (4,5,6,7), (8,9,10,11), and (12,13,14,15), where each node has edges connecting it to all other nodes within its cluster, forming complete subgraphs."
