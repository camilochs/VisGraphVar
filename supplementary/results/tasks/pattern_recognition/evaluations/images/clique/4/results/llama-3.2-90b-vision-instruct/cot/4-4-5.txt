**Pattern Identification**

**Step 1: Observe the Structure**

The given image shows a graph with distinct clusters of nodes. Each cluster contains multiple nodes that are interconnected.

**Step 2: Determine the Pattern Type**

Upon closer inspection, it is evident that each cluster consists of a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes. This configuration matches the description of a 'star' pattern.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Patterns**

There are four clusters in the image, each representing a 'star' pattern.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the identified pattern type is 'star'. There are four instances of this pattern in the image.
