A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes or vertices connected by edges. Each node holds a value, and edges represent relationships between them.

**Pattern Identification**

Analyzing the graph image, we find it disconnected, with several small groupings of nodes. Two primary groupings emerge:

* A triangle with three nodes (9, 10, 11)
* A triangle with three nodes (5, 4, 3)

These groups are distinguishable by tight connections between nodes, forming a cluster that represents a clique pattern. In graph theory, a clique is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent; that is, its induced subgraph is a complete graph. A complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.

**Conclusion**

Based on the observed patterns, the graph contains two instances of cliques due to the formation of two triangles where every node within each triangle is directly connected to every other node. Consequently, the response would be generated accordingly in JSON format.

This analysis identifies two clique patterns in the graph, defined by tight connections between all nodes within each group.
