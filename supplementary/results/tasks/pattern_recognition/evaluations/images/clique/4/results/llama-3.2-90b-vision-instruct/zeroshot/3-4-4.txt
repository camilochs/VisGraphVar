**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the provided graph image, we need to examine its structure and connections.

Upon analyzing the graph, we observe:

* Vertices 1, 2, and 3 are interconnected, forming a tight cluster.
* Vertex 4 is isolated with vertices 5, 6, and 7, not connected to the rest of the graph.
* Vertices 8, 9, 10, and 11 form another densely connected cluster.
* Vertices 12, 13, 14, and 15 are grouped together, resembling a disconnected subset.

Based on these observations:

* **Pattern:** 'clique'
* **Number of Patterns:** 3
* **Analysis:** The graph contains three distinct cliques, each consisting of a group of densely interconnected vertices without any connections between the groups. This characteristic is indicative of a clique pattern.

**Response:**

```json
{
    'pattern': 'clique',
    'number_of_patterns': 3,
    'analysis': 'The graph consists of three distinct, densely interconnected groups of vertices without connections between the groups, which is characteristic of cliques.'
}
