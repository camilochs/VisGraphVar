   1. Observing the structure, we see distinct clusters of nodes.
   2. Each cluster consists of three nodes where all nodes within the cluster are interconnected.
   3. No node appears to be central, but rather all are equally connected within their clusters.
   4. This characterizes a 'clique' pattern where each subset of nodes is fully connected.

   Therefore, there are four instances of cliques in the image."
