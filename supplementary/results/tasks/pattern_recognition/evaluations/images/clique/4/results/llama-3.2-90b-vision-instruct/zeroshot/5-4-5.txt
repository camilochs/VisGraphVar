The provided graph image, upon analysis, reveals a chain pattern. This conclusion is reached by examining the structure and topology of the graph. A chain pattern in a graph is characterized by a sequence of nodes where each node is connected to exactly two other nodes, one preceding it in the chain and the other succeeding it, except for the first and last nodes, which are connected to only one other node each.

**Reasoning Steps:**

1. **Observation of Node Connections:** The graph displays nodes (represented as small circles or dots) connected by lines, indicating edges between them. Each node seems to be directly connected to only a couple of others, which is a key characteristic of a chain pattern.

2. **Absence of Central Node:** A star pattern would feature a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, none of which are directly connected to each other. This characteristic is not observed in the given graph.

3. **Lack of a Clique:** A clique is a subset of nodes where every node is connected to every other node. The graph does not display this kind of connectivity among its nodes, ruling out the presence of a clique pattern.

4. **Linear Arrangement of Nodes:** The nodes in the graph appear to be arranged linearly along bolder lines, which is consistent with a chain pattern. The positions of the nodes relative to each other suggest a sequential connection rather than random or clustered connections typical of other patterns.

5. **Edge Count and Distribution:** Each node seems to have a consistent number of edges (two or fewer), further supporting the chain pattern hypothesis. A consistent edge count is more indicative of a structured connectivity pattern like a chain than of random or fully connected patterns.

**Conclusion:**

Given these observations, the graph image best fits the description of a chain pattern. There appears to be only one discernible pattern of this type within the image.
