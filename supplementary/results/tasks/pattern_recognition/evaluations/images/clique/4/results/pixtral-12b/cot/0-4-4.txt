Such a layout does not correspond to a chain or a clique where all nodes are interconnected.\nStep 3: There are four such star patterns in the graph, each having one central node and multiple peripheral nodes.\nStep 4: The concluding pattern type is a star based on centrality and connectivity patterns."
