    1. The cluster at the top-center: Nodes 11, 12, 13, and 14 form a fully interconnected group (clique).
    2. The right-side cluster: Nodes 7, 6, and 8 form a fully interconnected group (clique).
    3. The left-side cluster: Nodes 17, 16, 19, and potentially 5 form a fully interconnected group (clique).
    4. The bottom-center cluster: Nodes 1, 3, and 4 form a fully interconnected group (clique).

    Every node in the identified clusters is linked to each other without any node being excluded or isolated within a cluster. This configuration satisfies the definition of a 'clique.')
