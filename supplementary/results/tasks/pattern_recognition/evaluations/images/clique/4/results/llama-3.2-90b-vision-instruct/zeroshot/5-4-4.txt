**Property to determine:** The type of pattern in the graph image.

**Relevant data:**

* The graph consists of multiple clusters of nodes.
* Each cluster has a central node connected to multiple other nodes.
* There are no connections between nodes in different clusters.

**Analysis:**

Based on the features observed in the graph, it appears that there are multiple subgraphs or communities within the larger graph. Each of these subgraphs represents a cluster of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to nodes outside their cluster. This characteristic is indicative of a specific type of pattern.

**Pattern identification:**

Given the presence of these clusters and their connectivity, the pattern in the graph resembles a "clique." A clique is a subset of vertices in an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent; that is, its induced subgraph is a complete graph. In this case, while not every cluster forms a complete subgraph (where every node is connected to every other node in the cluster), their dense connection and relative isolation from other clusters align with the broader concept of cliques in graph theory.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, the pattern detected in the graph can be classified as a 'clique' pattern, with multiple occurrences indicating the existence of more than one clique within the graph.

**Response in JSON format:**

{
  "pattern": ["clique"],
  "number_of_patterns": 4,
  "analysis": "The graph exhibits clusters of densely connected nodes, characteristic of cliques or near-clique structures, with minimal connections outside these clusters."
}
```

This conclusion is based on the visual inspection of the graph structure and the definition of a clique in the context of graph theory.
