**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we need to carefully analyze its structure and relationships among nodes.

**Step 1: Observe the Structure**

Upon examining the graph, we notice that there are several distinct clusters or groups of nodes. These clusters are not interconnected in a continuous sequence, nor do they form a fully interconnected clique without isolated nodes.

**Step 2: Identify Distinct Clusters**

We can identify at least five distinct clusters:

*   Cluster 1: Nodes 1, 16, 15, 19
*   Cluster 2: Nodes 4, 3, 2
*   Cluster 3: Nodes 13, 11, 14, 10, 12
*   Cluster 4: Nodes 9, 6, 8, 7

These clusters resemble a star-like pattern, with a central node surrounded by peripheral nodes.

**Step 3: Determine the Pattern Type**

Based on the observation that each cluster has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, we can conclude that the pattern type is a 'star.'

**Step 4: Count the Number of Patterns**

There are 4 instances of the 'star' pattern in the graph.

**Conclusion**

The identified pattern type is a 'star,' with a total of 4 instances in the graph. The layout and relationships among nodes suggest that each cluster has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, characteristic of a star pattern.
