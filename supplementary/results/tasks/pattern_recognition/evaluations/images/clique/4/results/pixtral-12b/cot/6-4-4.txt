   "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters that each follow a 'star' pattern. Each cluster has a central node with several peripheral nodes connected to it. 

   The clusters are as follows:

   1. Cluster in the top center with nodes {14, 13, 15, 12} all connected to a central node.
   
   2. Cluster in the left bottom section with nodes {9, 10, 8, 11} all connected to a central node.
   
   3. Cluster in the right bottom section with node {3, 0} connected to a central node.
   
   4. Cluster in the top right section with nodes {6, 5, 4, 7} all connected to a central node.

   This structure indicates that the clusters follow the star pattern where each central node connects to the peripheral nodes."
