**Pattern Identification**

To identify the pattern type in the graph, we follow these steps:

1. **Observe the structure**: The graph consists of multiple clusters or groups of nodes. Each cluster has nodes that are connected to each other directly.
2. **Identify distinct patterns**: Upon closer inspection, it's clear that each cluster does not share connections with other clusters. Within each cluster, all nodes are interconnected without any isolated nodes. This suggests that each cluster represents a clique, as every node within a cluster is connected to every other node in that cluster.
3. **Count instances of each pattern**: There are 5 clusters in total, each representing a clique.

**Conclusion**

Based on the layout and relationships among nodes in the graph, we conclude the following:

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 5,
   'analysis': 'The graph consists of isolated clusters where each cluster contains a complete interconnection among its nodes, fitting the definition of a clique. Since there are five such distinct groups, the count of cliques in the graph is five.'
}
```

This analysis demonstrates that the graph is composed of 5 distinct cliques with no instances of chains or star patterns observed.
