   "pattern": ["clique"],
   "number_of_patterns": 4,
   "analysis": "1. Each group of nodes is fully interconnected within itself without isolation. Each node in a group is connected to every other node in its group. 
   
2. There are no external connections between different groups of nodes.
  
3. The layout of the groups does not form a continuous sequence or a central node with peripheral nodes, as every connection within a group is pairwise.
  
4. We observe four distinct fully-interconnected clusters, which confirm this as a 'clique' pattern type."
