                Step 2: Each cluster consists of a central node with surrounding nodes, indicating a 'star' pattern. 
                Step 3: Counting the instances, there are three main clusters within the image, each characterized by the central node and its adjacent nodes.
                Step 4: The design of each cluster validates the 'star' pattern as it follows a central node surrounded by additional connected nodes."
