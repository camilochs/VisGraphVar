   "analysis": "The graph contains multiple distinct clusters of nodes. Each cluster has three nodes that are fully interconnected with no isolated nodes, forming a 'clique.' There are four such cliques in the graph: {0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8}, and {9, 10, 11}. Each set of three nodes is fully connected, confirming the clique pattern."
