To identify the pattern type in the graph image, we follow these steps:

1. **Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links**:

   - The graph consists of several non-overlapping clusters, each containing multiple nodes.
   - Each cluster contains nodes that are interconnected but do not form a single continuous sequence.

2. **Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star')**:

   - Upon closer inspection, it is evident that each cluster represents a fully interconnected group of nodes without any isolated nodes, indicative of a 'clique' pattern.

3. **Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph**:

   - There are 5 distinct clusters, each representing a separate instance of the 'clique' pattern.

4. **Explain reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes**:

   - The analysis reveals that all nodes within each cluster are connected to every other node, fulfilling the criteria for a 'clique' pattern.
   - The lack of isolated nodes or a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes further supports this classification.

**JSON Response:**

```json
{
   "pattern": "clique",
   "number_of_patterns": 5,
   "analysis": "The graph exhibits multiple fully interconnected groups of nodes, devoid of isolated nodes or a central node with peripheral nodes, confirming it as a clique pattern."
}
```

The identified pattern type is a clique, with 5 instances present in the graph.
