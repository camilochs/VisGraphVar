   "analysis": "The graph shows 4 distinct clique patterns. A clique is a group of nodes where each node is directly connected to every other node in the group. Looking at the graph: 1) One clique contains nodes 12,13,14,15 in the upper left. 2) Another clique contains nodes 8,9,10,11 in the upper right. 3) A third clique contains nodes 4,5,6,7 in the lower left. 4) The fourth clique contains nodes 0,1,2,3 in the lower right. In each case, every node in the group is interconnected with all other nodes in its respective group, forming complete subgraphs, which is the definition of a clique pattern."
