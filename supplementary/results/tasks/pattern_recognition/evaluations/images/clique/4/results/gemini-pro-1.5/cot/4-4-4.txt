  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct groups of nodes. Within each group, every node is connected to every other node in that group, which is the definition of a clique. There are no connections between the different groups. The cliques are composed of nodes {0, 1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7}, {8, 9, 10, 11}, and {12, 13, 14, 15}. Therefore there are four separate cliques."
