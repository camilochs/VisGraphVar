I'm sorry, but as a text-based model I do not have the capability to visually analyze images or graphs. However, I can provide an example response based on a hypothetical graph:

```json
{
    "pattern": "star",
    "number_of_patterns": 4,
    "analysis": "The graph appears to be organized into distinct clusters, with each cluster centered around a single central node that connects to the surrounding peripherals but has no direct connection to neighboring clusters. This central-peripheral structure that I observed across four groups across the graph is what led me to label the pattern as a 'star'."
}
```

To properly analyze an image using the given steps, it would be helpful to have access to or be shown the actual image.
