Analyzing the Graph Pattern

To identify the pattern type, follow these steps:

* Identify distinct clusters, groups, or links
* Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (chain), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (clique), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (star)
* Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph
* Explain your reasoning based on the layout and relationships among nodes

The graph image displays isolated node clusters.

**Step 1: Observe the Structure**
Upon inspection, you will notice that the graph contains isolated clusters of nodes, each forming a small group.

**Step 2: Determine Node Interconnection**
Within each cluster, nodes are fully interconnected without isolated nodes, which indicates the presence of cliques. However, there are no continuous sequences of interconnected nodes (chains) or central nodes with surrounding peripheral nodes (stars).

**Step 3: Count Pattern Instances**
You can count four clusters, each representing a clique. There are no instances of chains or stars in this graph.

**Step 4: Explain Reasoning**
Based on the graph layout, where nodes within clusters are fully interconnected and the absence of chains or stars, it can be inferred that this pattern consists of multiple cliques.

**Pattern Identification**

```json
{
   'pattern': '[clique]',
   'number_of_patterns': '[4]',
   'analysis': 'This analysis confirms pattern type as clique with four repetitions from distinct node clusters, without chains or stars due to solely interconnected, multi-cluster layout..'
}
```

Result: Clique with four repetitions
