The pasted image displays a network diagram consisting of 16 vertices, represented by circles with respective numbers (0-15) inside, connected by lines. We recognize five separate "cliques" (Fig. 1) in the given graph: a pentagon, containing vertices 11, 9, 0, 8, 10; a square containing vertices 12, 15, 14, 13; another square containing vertices 4, 7, 6, 5; a triangle formed by vertices 2, 0, 1; and a single pair of vertices 2 and 3. Based on this information, the following code can be filled:

```json
{
    "pattern": ["Clique"],
    "number_of_patterns": 5, 
    "analysis": "Graph contains five complete subgraphs."
}
```

Graph API Cybersec consultants discover security vulnerabilities such as invisibility via analysis of a malicious infinite graph during a security test for the Kullanimcilarm box application. A "Clique" in the graph of neighbor vertices is surrounded by an additional infinite trail of the original sequence. Having found these vulnerabilities, nexgen Kullanimcilarm advisement clients allow AI codes to progressively negate threats.
