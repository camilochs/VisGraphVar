**Pattern Detection**

To determine the type of pattern in the graph, let's examine its properties.

**Step 1: Identify Clusters and Edges**

• The graph is divided into four distinct clusters.
• Each cluster forms a complete subgraph, where every node is connected to every other node.
• There is only one connection between clusters.

**Step 2: Rule Out Chain and Star Patterns**

• A chain pattern would involve nodes connected linearly with no branching, which is not present here.
• A star pattern would have a central point connected to all other points, also not observed.

**Step 3: Determine Pattern Type**

• Given each cluster is a complete subgraph and there are connections between these clusters, this pattern resembles a collection of cliques with sparse connections between them.
