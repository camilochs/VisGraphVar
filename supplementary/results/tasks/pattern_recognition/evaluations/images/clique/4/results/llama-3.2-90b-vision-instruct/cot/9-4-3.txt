**Pattern Analysis**

To analyze the pattern in the given graph image, we follow these steps:

* **Step 1: Observe the Structure and Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links**
	+ The graph consists of several groups of nodes.
	+ Each group contains multiple nodes that are directly connected to each other.
	+ There are no isolated nodes or chains of nodes in a sequence.
* **Step 2: Determine the Pattern Type**
	+ Based on the observation, each group represents a clique.
	+ A clique is a subset of nodes where every node is connected to every other node.
	+ There are no central nodes with surrounding peripheral nodes, indicating there are no star patterns.
	+ There are no sequential connections, indicating there are no chain patterns.
* **Step 3: Count the Number of Patterns**
	+ There are five groups of nodes with each group being a clique.
	+ All nodes within a group are interconnected.
* **Conclusion**
	+ The pattern type in the graph is a clique.
	+ There are five instances of this pattern type in the image.

**JSON Format Answer**

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 5,
   'analysis': 'The graph is composed of multiple groups where each node within a group is connected to every other node, forming cliques. Since all nodes in a group are fully interconnected and there are five such groups, the identified pattern is "clique" with a total count of five instances.'
