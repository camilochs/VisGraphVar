  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct groups of interconnected nodes. In each group, every node is directly connected to every other node within the same group, forming a complete subgraph or a clique. There are no connections between nodes belonging to different groups. Specifically, there are four such cliques, each made of interconnected nodes. therefore, the identified pattern is 'clique', and the number of patterns is four."
