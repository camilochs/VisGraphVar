   "analysis": "The graph shows four distinct groups of three nodes each. In each group, the nodes are fully interconnected, forming complete triangles or cliques. The groups are: (0,1,2), (3,4,5), (6,7,8), and (9,10,11). Each of these groups demonstrates the clique pattern where every node is connected to every other node within its group. The groups are isolated from each other with no connections between different cliques. This creates a clear pattern of four separate 3-node cliques distributed across the graph space."
