   "analysis": "The graph contains four distinct groups where each node is interconnected without any isolated nodes, representing a complete subgraph or 'clique.' The cliques are: (0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), and (9, 10, 11). Each group forms a triangle where every node connects directly to every other node within the group, fitting the definition of cliques."
