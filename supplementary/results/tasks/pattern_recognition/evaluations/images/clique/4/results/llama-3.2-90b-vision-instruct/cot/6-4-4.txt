**Step 1: Observe the structure and identify distinct clusters, groups, or links**

The graph image displays a collection of numbered nodes, some of which are grouped together in clusters. These clusters are labeled with numbers ranging from 0 to 16.

**Step 2: Determine if nodes are interconnected in a continuous sequence (for a 'chain'), fully interconnected without isolated nodes (for a 'clique'), or if there is a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (for a 'star')**

Upon closer inspection, we notice that each cluster consists of fully interconnected nodes without any isolated nodes. This characteristic is indicative of a "clique" pattern.

**Step 3: Count how many instances of each identified pattern appear in the graph**

We observe five distinct clusters in the graph:

* Cluster 1: Nodes 2, 3, and 0
* Cluster 2: Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7
* Cluster 3: Nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11
* Cluster 4: Nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15
* Cluster 5: Node 1 (stands alone)

Each cluster represents an instance of the "clique" pattern, except for Cluster 5, which is an isolated node and does not form a clique.

**Step 4: Explain reasoning**

Based on the layout and relationships among nodes, we conclude that the graph exhibits the "clique" pattern. The presence of fully interconnected nodes within each cluster, with no isolated nodes, supports this identification. Notably, Cluster 5 does not meet this criterion, as it comprises a single isolated node.
