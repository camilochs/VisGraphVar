   "analysis": "The graph consists of five distinct clusters, each containing three interconnected nodes. In each cluster, the nodes are fully connected to each other, forming a complete subgraph known as a 'clique'. There are no isolated nodes or chains present, and there is no central node with peripheral nodes that would indicate a 'star' pattern. Therefore, the identified pattern type is 'clique'."
