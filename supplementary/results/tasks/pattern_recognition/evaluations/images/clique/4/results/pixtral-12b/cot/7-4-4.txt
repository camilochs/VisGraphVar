   "analysis": "Step 1: The graph is divided into four separate groups of nodes. Each group contains exactly four nodes. 
                Step 2: In each group, there is a clear central node that is connected to all other nodes in the group. This forms a central node with surrounding peripheral nodes, typical of a 'star' pattern.
                Step 3: By counting, there are exactly four instances of this 'star' pattern across the entire graph.
                Step 4: The pattern observed can be confirmed by visually inspecting that each node in the group is connected to one central node, creating a star shape."
