   'analysis': 'To determine the pattern type in the given graph, we need to follow these steps: 

1. First, observe the structure of the graph and identify the distinct clusters of nodes.
2. Notice that there are four main of nodes in the graph, each containing 3 nodes.
3. Next, analyze each cluster to determine the connectivity of the nodes within them. 
    - In the top right cluster: The nodes 3, 4, and 5 form a triangle where all nodes are interconnected.
    - In the bottom right cluster: The nodes 9, 10, and 11 form a triangle where all nodes are interconnected.
    - In the bottom left cluster: The nodes 1, 2, and 0 form a triangle where all nodes are interconnected.
    - In the top left cluster: The nodes 6, 7, and 8 form a triangle where all nodes are interconnected.
4. Each of these triangles can be viewed as a fully interconnected set of nodes within a limited area, which fits the “clique” pattern's criteria.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the graph consists of cliques (fully interconnected groups) of nodes, each triplet within a cluster represents a clique.'
