   "analysis": "The graph is composed of four distinct clusters, each with three nodes that are fully interconnected. There are no isolated nodes or continuous sequences, indicating that the pattern is a 'clique'. Each clique contains three nodes, forming a triangular shape. There is no central node with surrounding peripheral nodes, which rules out the 'star' pattern. Therefore, the identified pattern is 'clique', and there are four instances of this pattern in the graph."
