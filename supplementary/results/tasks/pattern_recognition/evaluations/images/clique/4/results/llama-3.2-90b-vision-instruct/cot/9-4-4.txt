I'm sorry, but I don't have access to the given image. I can provide general guidance on how this task would be approached.

In a typical pattern-identification problem, we'd follow these steps:

### Step 1: Observe the pattern's structure
- *Identify clusters or groups:* In the graph, look for distinct clusters or groups of nodes that are connected to each other. These could be fully interconnected (clique), in a sequence (chain), or surrounding a central node (star).
- *Links and interconnectedness:* Determine how nodes are interconnected. Check if any nodes are isolated or part of a larger structure.

### Step 2: Determine the pattern type
- *Chain:* If the nodes form a continuous sequence where each node (except the first and last) is connected to exactly two others.
- *Clique:* If all nodes in a group are fully interconnected, meaning each node is directly connected to every other node.
- *Star:* If there's a central node connected to several peripheral nodes, and those peripheral nodes are not interconnected among themselves.

### Step 3: Count instances of each pattern
- For each identified pattern (chain, clique, star), count how many distinct instances exist in the graph.

### Step 4: Analyze the pattern(s) identified
- Provide a detailed explanation of why a particular pattern type was chosen based on the graph's structure and the relationships among its nodes.

### JSON Response
Since there's no image provided, we cannot accurately complete the task. However, for a hypothetical situation where 'star' patterns are identified:

```json
{
  "pattern": "star",
  "number_of_patterns": 3,
  "analysis": "The graph contains clusters with a clear central node in each, surrounded by peripheral nodes not directly connected to each other. This layout matches the definition of a 'star' pattern. Given the presence of these structures, it is evident the graph predominantly features 'star' patterns."
}
```

Please note that without the actual graph, this response is speculative.
