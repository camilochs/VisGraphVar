  "analysis": "The graph consists of four distinct clusters of nodes. In each cluster, every node is connected to every other node within the same cluster. This complete interconnectedness within each group identifies each as a 'clique.'  There are no connections between the cliques. Each clique pattern consists of three nodes. Therefore, there are four clique patterns present in the graph."
