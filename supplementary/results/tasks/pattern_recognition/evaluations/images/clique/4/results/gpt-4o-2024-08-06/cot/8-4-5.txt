   "analysis": "The graph is composed of five distinct clusters. Each cluster contains nodes that are fully interconnected, forming a complete graph or 'clique.' In these cliques, each node is connected to every other node in the cluster without any isolated nodes. The clusters visible in the graph are: 1-2-3-4, 5-6-7-8-9, 10-11-12-13-14, 15-16-17-18-19. This results in a total of 5 cliques in the graph."
