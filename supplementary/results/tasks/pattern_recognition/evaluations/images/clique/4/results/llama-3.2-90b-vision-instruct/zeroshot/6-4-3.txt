**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

The provided graph image is analyzed to determine the type of pattern it contains. Based on the configuration of the nodes and edges, the following key observations are made by inspecting the graph:

1. **Node Arrangement**: The graph consists of multiple nodes arranged in small clusters with two or more nodes per cluster. Each cluster itself does not have more than two interconnected nodes at a time.

2. **Interconnections Between Clusters**: There are no edges connecting one cluster to another; each cluster stands independently.

3. **Definition of Patterns**:
   - **Chain Pattern**: A sequence of nodes interconnected by edges, resembling a chain-like structure.
   - **Clique Pattern**: A group of nodes all interconnected with each other, forming a complete subgraph.
   - **Star Pattern**: A central node connected to all other nodes in the graph, but those other nodes do not connect to each other.

Given these definitions, the graph exhibits a **clique pattern**. Each cluster forms a small clique because within each cluster, all nodes are connected to each other. However, there are no interconnections between different clusters, and there is no single central node connected to all other nodes as would be seen in a star pattern, nor is there a chain-like connection of nodes across the graph.

**Conclusion**

```json
{
  "pattern": ["clique"],
  "number_of_patterns": 4,
  "analysis": "The graph shows clusters where all nodes within each cluster are connected, fitting the definition of a clique. The lack of inter-cluster connections and the absence of a chain or star topology support this conclusion."
}
```

This analysis identifies four separate clique patterns in the graph based on the arrangement of the nodes and their connectivity.
