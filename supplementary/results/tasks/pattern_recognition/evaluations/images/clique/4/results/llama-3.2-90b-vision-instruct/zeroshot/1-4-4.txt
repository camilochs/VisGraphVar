**Pattern Type and Analysis**

The graph exhibits the following characteristics:

* The nodes are grouped into four clusters.
* Each cluster has one node connected to multiple other nodes, while the other nodes in the cluster are not interconnected.

This distribution of connections points to a **star pattern**, a type of graph structure where one central node (the "hub") connects directly to other nodes.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': 'The presence of central nodes connected to multiple other nodes without interconnection among the latter indicates a star pattern.'
} 
```
