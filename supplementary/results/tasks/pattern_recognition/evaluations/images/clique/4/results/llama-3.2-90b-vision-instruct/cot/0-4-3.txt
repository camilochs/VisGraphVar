The image shows a connected graph with points along separate segments.

**Step 1: Identifying clusters not in the image**

This graph displays four separate sets of points without overlap or interconnection. Each group represents a distinct segment within the graph.

**Step 2: Recognizing a clique environment**

These sets symbolize cliques, seen in segregated groups. They have a continuous sequence of interconnected nodes, a key characteristic of a clique.

**Step 3: Counting instances of the recognized pattern**

There are four cliques present in the image.

**Conclusion**

The image features four interconnected point sets, and you should consider this when reporting the pattern occurrences.

The resulting JSON file is structured as follows:

```
{
  'pattern': 'clique',
  'number_of_patterns': 4,
  'analysis': 'The image displays a clique pattern with four separate sets of points. These distinct sets display a continuous sequence of interconnected nodes without any isolated points, confirming a clique structure.'
}
