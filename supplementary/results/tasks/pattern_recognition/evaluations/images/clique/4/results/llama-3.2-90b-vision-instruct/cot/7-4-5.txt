**Analysis of the Graph Pattern**

### Step 1: Identify Distinct Clusters, Groups, or Links

* Four distinct clusters are visible in the graph: one at the top left, one at the top right, one at the bottom left, and one at the bottom right.
* Each cluster consists of nodes that are interconnected internally.

### Step 2: Determine the Pattern Type

* Upon closer inspection, each cluster shows that all its nodes are fully interconnected with each other without any isolated nodes.

### Step 3: Count Instances of Each Identified Pattern

* There are four instances of this pattern type in the graph.

### Conclusion

The given pattern should be classified as a "clique" since all nodes within each cluster are interconnected with each other. This fully interconnected structure aligns with the definition of a clique pattern. The analysis provides a step-by-step explanation of the graph's layout and the reasoning behind identifying the pattern type.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'All nodes within each cluster are fully interconnected with each other, which is the defining characteristic of a clique pattern.'
}
