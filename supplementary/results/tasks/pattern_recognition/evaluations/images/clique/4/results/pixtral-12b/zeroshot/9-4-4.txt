Based on the provided graph image, here is the analysis in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   'pattern': ['star'],
   'number_of_patterns': [4],
   'analysis': 'The image depicts a graph with four distinct \'star\' patterns. Each central node is connected to other peripheral nodes, with no additional connections between these peripheral nodes. This characteristic arrangement is indicative of a star formation where all edges connect from a central node to multiple peripheral nodes, creating a radial layout.'
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph consists of four patterns, each of which is a star formation.
- A "star" pattern has a central node connected to multiple peripheral nodes, with no connections between the peripheral nodes.
- This structure is evident in the provided graph image, where each central node (4, 0, 5, and another central node in the bottom-right cluster) connects directly to the surrounding nodes without additional interconnections.
