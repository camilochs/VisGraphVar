Specifically, each star pattern corresponds to a distinct set of nodes:\n1. Nodes 8, 9, 10, and 11 form a star centered at node 10.\n2. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a star centered at node 1.\n3. Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7 form a star centered at node 4.\n4. Nodes 12, 13, 14, and 15 form a star centered at node 12."
