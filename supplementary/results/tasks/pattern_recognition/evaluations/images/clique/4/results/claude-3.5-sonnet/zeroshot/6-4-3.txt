   "analysis": "The graph contains 4 separate clique patterns, where each set of three nodes is fully connected to each other. These cliques are formed by nodes {0,1,2}, {3,4,5}, {6,7,8}, and {9,10,11}. In each clique, every node is connected to every other node within its group, forming complete triangular connections."
