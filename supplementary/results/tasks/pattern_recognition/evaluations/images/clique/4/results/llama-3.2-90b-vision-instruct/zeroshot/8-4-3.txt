**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the given graph image, we need to examine the structure and relationships between the nodes. 

* A chain pattern would involve nodes connected in a linear sequence.
* A clique pattern would show multiple nodes all connected to each other.
* A star pattern would feature one central node connected to multiple other nodes, which in turn are not connected to each other.

Upon examining the graph, we observe:

* Nodes 0, 1, and 2 form a small clique as they are all connected to each other.
* Similarly, nodes 3, 4, and 5 form another clique.
* Nodes 6, 7, and 8 constitute a third clique.
* Nodes 9, 10, and 11 form a fourth clique.

There are no linear sequences of nodes as would be expected in a chain pattern, nor is there a central node connected to multiple disconnected nodes as in a star pattern. Instead, the graph is composed of fully connected subgraphs (cliques) with no connections between these subgraphs.
