**Pattern Analysis**

To determine the type of pattern in the graph, we will analyze its structure and connectivity.

**Relevant Elements**

* The graph consists of 11 nodes (0-10) with various connections between them.
* There are no obvious linear sequences (chains) among the nodes.
* Multiple nodes are directly connected to each other without forming a central hub or star.

**Analysis**

Upon examining the graph, we observe that there are three distinct clusters:

1. Nodes 1, 2, and 0 are fully connected to each other.
2. Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are fully connected to each other.
3. Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are fully connected to each other.

These clusters exhibit the characteristics of cliques, where every node within each cluster is connected to every other node.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph exhibits a clique pattern due to the multiple fully connected clusters present.
