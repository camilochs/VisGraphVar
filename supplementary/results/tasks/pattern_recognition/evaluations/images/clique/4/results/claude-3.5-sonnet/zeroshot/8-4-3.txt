    "analysis": "The graph contains 4 separate clique patterns, where each group consists of 3 nodes that are fully connected to each other. These cliques can be found with nodes (0,1,2), (3,4,5), (6,7,8), and (9,10,11). Each node in these groups is connected to every other node in its group, forming complete triangular structures, which is characteristic of clique patterns."
