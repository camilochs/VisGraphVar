To analyze the pattern in this figure, we label the vertices and follow these steps from left to right:

The cluster on the left has a single vertex connected to 3 other vertices, indirectly connected by a vertex chain segment involving 2 vertices, implying a star pattern. Similarly, the large cluster below right and the cluster in the middle both show a common characteristic, from a vertex with the most outward connective extensions: these are cliques, with fully interconnected subgroups that offset from each other by a vertex node.

Since the indicated patterns are a clique, a chain, then another clique, the analysis is as follows:
```json
{
   'pattern': ['star', 'clique', 'chain'],
   'number_of_patterns': 3,
   'analysis': 'In the figure, the star pattern, with multiple vertices connected to one source vertex, was called a star because it was similar to a starfish. The clique pattern implies a complete set of edges connecting all the vertices together, so an offset clique pattern with an intersecting vertex indicates a chain pattern.'
}
```

Our final answer is: Based on the given data figure above, it contains a star, clique, and chain in the graph.
