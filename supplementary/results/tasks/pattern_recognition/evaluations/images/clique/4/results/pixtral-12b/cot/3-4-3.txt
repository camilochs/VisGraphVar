Step 2: Each cluster appears to have nodes that are fully interconnected with no external connections. This indicates a "clique" pattern where each node within a cluster is connected to every other node in the same cluster.

Step 3: There are exactly four clusters in the image.

Step 4: Given the layout and relationships among nodes, each of the clusters can be defined as a "clique" as all nodes within a cluster are connected to each other.'
