   "analysis": "The graph shows 4 distinct clique patterns. A clique is identified when all nodes in a group are fully interconnected with each other. Looking at the graph: 1) First clique in top-left contains nodes 0,1,2,3; 2) Second clique in middle contains nodes 4,5,6,7; 3) Third clique in bottom-left has nodes 8,9,10,11; 4) Fourth clique in top-right contains nodes 12,13,14,15. Each group forms a complete subgraph where every node is connected to every other node within its group, which is the definition of a clique pattern."
