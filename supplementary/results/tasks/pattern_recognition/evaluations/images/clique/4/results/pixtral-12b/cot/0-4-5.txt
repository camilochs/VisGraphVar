   "analysis": "To determine the pattern, we observed the structure of the graph and identified distinct clusters. Each cluster consists of a central node surrounded by peripheral nodes. This layout is characteristic of a 'star' pattern. We thus identified four separate star patterns in the image, each having a central node with surrounding nodes."
