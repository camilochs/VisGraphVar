The graph image comprises four clusters of interconnected nodes, indicating the presence of cliques. Each node forms a complete subgraph, typifying a clique pattern.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   'pattern': 'clique',
   'number_of_patterns': 4,
   'analysis': 'In each cluster, each node (numbered 1-20) directly connects to every other node that shares the same cluster boundary, absent isolated nodes or chain-like sequential connections.'
}
```
