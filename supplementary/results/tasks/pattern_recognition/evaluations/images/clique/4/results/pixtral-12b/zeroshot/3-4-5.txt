The first clique includes node pairs {13, 16}, {17, 19}, {18}, illustrating a full structure. The second clique has node pairs {13, 11}, {14, 10}, {12} displaying mutual connections. The third clique consists of nodes {9, 6}, {7}, {8}, following a similar complete interconnection pattern within each subgroup.'
