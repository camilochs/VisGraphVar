   "analysis": "To identify the pattern in the image, we need to follow a step-by-step process: 

   1. Observe the structured layout of the nodes in the graph.
   2. Notice that each cluster of nodes has one central node with peripheral nodes surrounding it. This indicates a central node Episcopal with connections to immediate neighbors (peripheral nodes).
   3. Count the clusters: There are four distinct clusters in the image, each arranged in this star pattern.
   
   - The top cluster has node 8 as the central node with nodes 7 and 6 as the peripheral nodes.
   - The bottom right cluster has node 10 as the central node with nodes 9 and 11 as the peripheral nodes.
   - The bottom left cluster has node 5 as the central node with nodes 3 and 4 as the peripheral nodes.
   - The bottom cluster has node 2 as the central node with nodes 1 and 0 as the peripheral nodes.
   
   4. Therefore, based on the structured layout and relationships among the nodes, the pattern in this graph conforms to the 'star' type."
