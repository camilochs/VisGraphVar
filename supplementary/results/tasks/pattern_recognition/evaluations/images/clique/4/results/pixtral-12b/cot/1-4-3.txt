                2. Each cluster contains multiple nodes where every node is connected to every other node within the cluster, hence forming a "clique."
                3. There are four distinct groups in the graph, each fulfilling the criteria of a "clique." 
                4. No central node with surrounding peripheral nodes (Star pattern) is observed within the graph.
                5. As for a "chain," there are no continuous sequences where nodes are sequentially interconnected between groups.

            The graph contains four independent "cliques," each fully interconnected and isolated from the others.'
