To determine the pair of unconnected nodes that should be joined by an edge, let’s analyze the graph structure.

1. **Graph Structure Analysis**:
   - The graph consists of four nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
   - Node 2 is only connected to node 1.
   - Nodes 3 and 4 are both connected to node 1.

2. **Common Neighbors and Degree**:
   - Node 2 is connected to node 1.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
   - Nodes 2 and 4 do not share any common neighbors (0 common neighbors).
   - Nodes 2 and 3 both have one common neighbor (node 1).

3. **Node Positions and Recurring Patterns**:
   - Node 2 stands somewhat isolated with just one connection.
   - Nodes 3 and 4 are more integrated into the graph, both having multiple connections.
   - Recurring pattern shows connectivity hub at node 1 connecting intermediate points.

4. **Structural Holes and Connection Impact**:
   - Adding an edge between node 2 and node 4 would bridge a structural hole, linking isolated nodes to more central ones.
   - Connecting node 2 and node 4 would potentially integrate node 2 into the main structure, enhancing connectivity.
   - This connection maintains the graph’s non-centralized expansion pattern.

**Conclusion**: The most promising pair to connect is nodes 2 and 4.
