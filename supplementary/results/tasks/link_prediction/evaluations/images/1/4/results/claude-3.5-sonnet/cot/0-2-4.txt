    1. Structural patterns identified:
        - The graph shows a simple structure with 4 nodes forming a somewhat sparse network
        - There's a triangular formation between nodes 1, 3, and 4
        - Node 2 is connected to node 3 and forms a path with node 1 through node 3
        - The graph currently has 5 edges total
        
    2. Node selection reasoning:
        - Nodes 1 and 2 share node 3 as a common neighbor
        - The current path between nodes 1 and 2 requires two steps (through node 3)
        - Both nodes have relatively low degrees (node 1: degree 2, node 2: degree 2)
        - Adding this connection would create another triangle in the graph
        
    3. Topological fit:
        - The graph already contains one triangle formation (1-3-4)
        - Adding an edge between 1 and 2 would create a second triangle (1-2-3)
        - This maintains the pattern of triangular structures
        - It would increase the graph's overall density in a balanced way
        
    4. Expected impact:
        - Reduced average path length in the network
        - Increased clustering coefficient
        - Better network resilience through redundant paths
        - More balanced degree distribution among nodes"
