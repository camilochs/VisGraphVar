  "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 4 should be connected to complete the 4-clique (tetrahedron).  Currently, nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a triangle, and nodes 1, 3, and 4 form a triangle.  Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would create the final triangle (2, 3, 4), making a fully connected graph of 4 nodes."
