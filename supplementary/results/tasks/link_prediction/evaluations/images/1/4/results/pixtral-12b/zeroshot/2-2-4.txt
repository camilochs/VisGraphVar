    "nodes_prediction": [1, 2],
    "analysis": "Based on the graph's structure, nodes 1 and 2 should be connected by an edge. Both nodes are currently at the periphery of the graph, with node 1 connected to node 3 and node 2 connected to node 1. Although node 2 is separated from the cluster of nodes 3 and 4, connecting nodes 1 and 2 would potentially create a stronger linkage within the graph and balance the connectivity. This addition would enhance the overall symmetry and cohesion of the graph."
