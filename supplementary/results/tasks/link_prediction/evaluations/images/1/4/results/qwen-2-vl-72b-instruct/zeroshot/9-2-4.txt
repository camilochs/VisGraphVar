    "nodes_prediction": [2, 3],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 3 should be connected because they are currently isolated from each other. Adding an edge between them would maintain the symmetry and balance of the graph, similar to the existing edges connecting other pairs of nodes. This would result in a more uniform and interconnected structure."
