    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph structure, nodes 2 and 4 should logically be connected to complete the symmetry of the graph. Currently, the graph forms a kite-like shape with nodes 1 and 3 being connected to both nodes 2 and 4, but 2 and 4 aren't connected to each other. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would create a more balanced structure with two triangles (1-2-4 and 2-3-4), improving the overall connectivity and completing the natural diamond-shaped pattern that seems to be emerging in the graph."
