    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 4 should be connected because the graph appears to have a round pattern, and connecting nodes 2 and 4 would complete the consecutive connection sequence around the perimeter. Additionally, nodes 1 and 3 are currently connected, and adding the edge between nodes 2 and 4 would maintain the symmetry and structure of the graph."
