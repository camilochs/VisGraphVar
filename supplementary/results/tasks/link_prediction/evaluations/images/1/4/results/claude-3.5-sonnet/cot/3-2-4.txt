    "nodes_prediction": [2, 3],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a small network of 4 nodes
    - There is a triangle formation between nodes 1, 3, and 4
    - Node 2 is currently only connected to node 1, making it somewhat isolated
    - The graph has a 'star-like' pattern with node 1 being central

    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 3 were selected because:
      * They currently have no direct connection
      * They share a common neighbor (node 1)
      * Node 2 has low degree (1) and could benefit from more connections
      * This would create a second triangle in the graph (2-1-3)

    3. Topology fit:
    - The existing graph shows a preference for triangular structures (1-3-4)
    - Adding this edge would create symmetry in the graph
    - It maintains the pattern of nodes having multiple connections
    - It follows the principle of triadic closure

    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the graph's overall connectivity
    - Creates better redundancy in paths between nodes
    - Reduces the network's vulnerability by removing a leaf node
    - Improves the average clustering coefficient
    - Makes the graph more resilient by adding an alternative path"
