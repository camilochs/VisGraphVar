    1. Structural patterns identified:
        - The graph shows a small network of 4 nodes
        - Current edges form a somewhat triangular structure
        - Node 3 appears to be a central node with highest degree (3 connections)
        - Nodes 1 and 2 form a base structure with node 3
        - Node 4 is currently only connected to node 3

    2. Node selection reasoning:
        - Nodes 2 and 4 have the most common neighbors (they share node 3)
        - They also have similar structural positions in the graph
        - Both nodes currently have relatively low degrees (2 for node 2, 1 for node 4)
        - Their connection would complete a natural circuit in the graph

    3. Topological fit:
        - The connection would create a more balanced structure
        - It would maintain the graph's existing triangular pattern
        - The new edge would create multiple triangular subgraphs, which is common in real networks
        - It follows the principle of transitivity (friends of friends becoming friends)

    4. Expected impact:
        - Would increase the graph's overall density
        - Creates more redundant paths, improving network resilience
        - Balances the degree distribution among nodes
        - Enhances the network's clustering coefficient
