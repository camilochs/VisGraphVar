    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a simple structure with 4 nodes arranged in a roughly linear fashion
    - Node 1 appears to be a central node with connections to nodes 2 and 3
    - Node 4 is currently only connected to node 3, creating a somewhat sparse end section
    - There's a triangular pattern between nodes 1, 2, and 3

    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 are currently unconnected and represent the two end points of the graph
    - They share a common neighbor pattern through the path 2-1-3-4
    - Both nodes have relatively low degrees (2 has degree 2, 4 has degree 1)
    
    3. Topological fit:
    - Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would create a cycle in the graph
    - This would increase the graph's overall connectivity and resilience
    - It would maintain symmetry with the existing triangular pattern
    - The connection would follow the natural flow of the current structure

    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the clustering coefficient of the graph
    - Creates multiple paths between all nodes, improving network reliability
    - Balances the degree distribution among nodes
    - Forms a more cohesive structure with better connectivity"
