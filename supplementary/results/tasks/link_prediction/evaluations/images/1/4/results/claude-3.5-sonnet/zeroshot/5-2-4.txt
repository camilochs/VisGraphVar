    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 4 should logically be connected to complete the pattern. Currently, both nodes 2 and 4 are connected to nodes 1 and 3, forming a partial quadrilateral structure. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would create a more stable and symmetric configuration, completing a fully connected subgraph pattern that's common in robust network structures. This connection would also increase the graph's overall resilience by adding an alternative path between these nodes."
