    "nodes_prediction": [1, 4],
    "analysis": "Based on the structure of the graph, nodes 1 and 4 are both connected to node 3. To preserve the connectivity and possibly form a more balanced or symmetrical structure, it would be logical to add an edge between nodes 1 and 4 to complete a quadrilateral, enhancing the overall connectivity and organization of the graph."
