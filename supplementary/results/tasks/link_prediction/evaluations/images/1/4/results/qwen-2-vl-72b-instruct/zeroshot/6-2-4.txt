    "nodes_prediction": [3, 4],
    "analysis": "In the given graph, nodes 3 and 4 are currently unconnected. Considering the structural pattern of the graph, where each node is connected to at least two other nodes, adding an edge between nodes 3 and 4 would maintain this pattern. This connection would also balance the graph's topology, creating a more symmetrical and cohesive structure."
