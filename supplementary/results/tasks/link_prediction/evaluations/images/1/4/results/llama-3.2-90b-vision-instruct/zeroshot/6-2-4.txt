**Identifying Unconnected Nodes That Should Be Connected**

The given image is a graph with an array of connections linking various nodes, which contain illustrative numbers ranging from 1 to 4. Analyzing the construct and inspecting each of the structural arms and the length relationships between them, leads to the conclusion that the nonadjacent nodes numbered 1 and 4 should be logically connected by an edge for improving the graph's symmetry balance and structural logic.

**Required Node Prediction JSON Object:** 
```json
{
    "nodes_prediction": [1, 4],
    "analysis": "Adding an edge between node 1 and node 4 will create symmetry by providing a direct connection between nodes 1 and 4, promoting balance within the graph's structure compared to the existing layout."
}
```
