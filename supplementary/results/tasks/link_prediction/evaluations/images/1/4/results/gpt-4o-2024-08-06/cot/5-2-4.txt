    1. The structural patterns you identified: The graph consists of four nodes with a triangular pattern involving nodes 1, 3, and 4, while node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3, forming a sort of 'Y' shape.\n
    2. Why these specific nodes were selected: Node 2 and node 4 are the only unconnected pair, and both have high connectivity around node 3. They do not share a direct link, but both are close to central nodes in the structure (node 1 and node 3).\n
    3. How this connection fits the graph's topology: Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would create a fully connected subgraph among the four nodes, enhancing cohesion and reinforcing symmetry in the graph.\n
    4. The expected impact of adding this edge: The new edge would fill the structural hole between nodes 2 and 4, potentially increasing the robustness of the network and facilitating better connectivity and communication within this small graph."
