    "nodes_prediction": [1, 4],
    "analysis": "Both node 1 and node 4 are currently at the ends of individual lines extending from the central nodes 2 and 3. To ensure that all nodes are directly interconnected and enhance the overall connectivity and symmetry of the graph, it makes logical sense to connect node 1 directly to node 4. This would complete a loop structure and improve the network's overall cohesion."
