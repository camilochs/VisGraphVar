    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. Structural Patterns:
    - The graph shows a diamond-like structure with nodes 1 and 3 having higher degrees (3 connections each)
    - Nodes 2 and 4 currently have lower degrees (2 connections each)
    - There's a pattern of triangular formations (1-3-4 and 1-2-3)
    - The graph has a symmetric quality except for the missing connection between nodes 2 and 4

    2. Node Selection Reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 share two common neighbors (nodes 1 and 3)
    - Their structural positions are symmetric in the graph
    - Both nodes have the same degree (2) currently
    - They are the only pair of nodes with multiple common neighbors that aren't directly connected

    3. Topological Fit:
    - Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete the graph's symmetry
    - It would create additional triangular formations, matching the existing pattern
    - The connection would maintain the balanced degree distribution
    - It follows the principle of triadic closure

    4. Expected Impact:
    - Would increase the graph's overall connectivity and resilience
    - Would create a more cohesive structure with equal degree distribution (all nodes would have degree 3)
    - Would enhance the graph's symmetry and balance
    - Would complete an additional cycle in the graph, improving information flow"
