    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 4 should logically be connected because they are currently the only non-adjacent pair in what would otherwise form a complete subgraph pattern. All other nodes in the graph have direct connections forming triangular patterns, but nodes 2 and 4 are only connected indirectly through nodes 1 and 3. Adding this edge would create a more balanced and symmetrical structure by completing the cycle and maintaining consistent connectivity patterns throughout the graph."
