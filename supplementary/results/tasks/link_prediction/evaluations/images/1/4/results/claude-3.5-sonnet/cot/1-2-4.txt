    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns:
    - The graph shows a diamond-like structure with nodes 1 and 3 connected at the bottom
    - There are crossing edges between nodes (1,2), (1,4), (3,2), and (3,4)
    - Each node currently has exactly 2 connections, except nodes 2 and 4 which have only 2 each
    - The graph exhibits symmetry along a vertical axis

    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 are the only pair of non-adjacent nodes that would complete the graph's symmetry
    - They share two common neighbors (nodes 1 and 3), suggesting a strong structural similarity
    - Their degrees are equal (2 each), indicating they play similar roles in the network

    3. Topology fit:
    - Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would create a complete subgraph
    - This would maintain the graph's symmetric nature
    - The connection would create a more robust network structure with redundant paths

    4. Expected impact:
    - Increased network density and connectivity
    - Enhanced resilience through additional path options
    - Complete the symmetric pattern of the graph
    - All nodes would have the same degree (3), creating a more balanced structure"
