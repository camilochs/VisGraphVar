    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph structure, nodes 2 and 4 should logically be connected to complete a balanced topology. Currently, every other pair of nodes in the graph is connected, forming multiple triangular patterns. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete this pattern of connectivity, creating another triangle and making the graph more symmetrical in terms of node degrees. This connection would also maintain the graph's apparent pattern of having multiple paths between nodes."
