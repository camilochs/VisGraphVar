    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. The structural patterns you identified: The graph appears to have a complete connection among nodes 1, 3, and further connections linking them to nodes 2 and 4. Nodes 2 and 4, however, are not directly connected but share common neighbors, specifically nodes 1 and 3. This creates a pattern suggestive of potential clusters forming between nodes [1, 2, 3] and [1, 3, 4].\n2. Why these specific nodes were selected: Nodes 2 and 4 were identified as a potential connection due to their shared neighbors and structural position. Both have exactly the same number of common neighbors (1 and 3), suggesting a strong underlying similarity in terms of connectivity and roles within the graph.\n3. How this connection fits the graph's topology: Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would form a complete subgraph among nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4, further solidifying the potential cluster structure. It also aligns with the existing dense connectivity patterns seen in other parts of the graph.\n4. The expected impact of adding this edge: This new edge would bridge a structural hole, creating a tighter-knit community structure and potentially improving information flow, resilience, or clustering within the graph."
