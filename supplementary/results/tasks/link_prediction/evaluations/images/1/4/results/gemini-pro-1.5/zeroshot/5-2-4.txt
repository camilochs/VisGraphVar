{
  "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
  "analysis": "Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.  Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.  This forms two sides of a quadrilateral. Connecting nodes 2 and 4 would complete the quadrilateral and preserve the graph's near-planar and somewhat symmetrical structure.  If there is a relationship between nodes 1 & 3 and 1 & 2 as well as between nodes 1 & 4 and 3 & 4, it stands to reason that the relationship should extend between nodes 2 & 4 as indicated by the existing pattern of connections."
