    "analysis": "Detailed step-by-step explanation of:
    1. The structural patterns you identified: The graph has a triangular structure between nodes 1, 3, and 4 with node 2 connecting to nodes 1 and 3. Adding the edge between 2 and 4 would create a second triangle involving nodes 2, 3, and 4, enhancing connectivity.
    2. Why these specific nodes were selected: Nodes 2 and 4 both connect to node 3, indicating some level of clustering or potential commonality. Connecting them would increase the graph's overall connectivity.
    3. How this connection fits the graph's topology: Adding an edge between these two nodes bridges a structural hole, reinforcing the clustering and forming a new 4-node complete graph.
    4. The expected impact of adding this edge: This connection increases redundancy and resilience within the network and enhances potential communication paths among highly connected nodes, maintaining the triangular patterns observed."
