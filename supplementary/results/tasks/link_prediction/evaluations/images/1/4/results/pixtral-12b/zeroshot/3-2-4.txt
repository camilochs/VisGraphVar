    "nodes_prediction": [1, 4],
    "analysis": "Node 1 and node 4 should logically be connected because they both have existing connections within the same subgraph region. This would help maintain the balance and connectivity within the graph, ensuring points with shared connections or proximity are linked to enhance the overall network consistency."
