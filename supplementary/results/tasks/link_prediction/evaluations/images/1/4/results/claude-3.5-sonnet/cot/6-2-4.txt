    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a diamond-like shape with 4 nodes
    - Current edges form an incomplete cycle (1-2-3-4-1)
    - Node 1 and 3 are connected, creating a diagonal
    - Each node currently has either 2 or 3 connections
    
    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 are the only pair not directly connected
    - They share two common neighbors (nodes 1 and 3)
    - Their structural positions are symmetric in the graph
    - Both nodes have similar degrees (2 connections each)
    
    3. Topology fit:
    - Adding edge 2-4 would complete the graph's symmetry
    - Would create a fully connected diamond pattern
    - Maintains the balanced degree distribution
    - Follows the existing pattern of triangular substructures
    
    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase graph's overall connectivity
    - Creates additional triangular clustering
    - Improves network resilience through redundant paths
    - Results in a more stable and symmetric structure"
