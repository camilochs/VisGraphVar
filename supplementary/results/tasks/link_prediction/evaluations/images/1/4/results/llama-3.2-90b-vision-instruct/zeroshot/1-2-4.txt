Based on the presented graph, the nodes that should logically be connected with an edge are the following:

```json
{
    "nodes_prediction": [1, 2],
    "analysis": "Despite being somewhat symmetrically positioned, these nodes had no edge connecting them, whereas nodes 1 and 2 each shared an edge with 3 and 4, respectively."
}
```
