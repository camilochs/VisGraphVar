    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. The structural patterns identified in the graph show two triangles connected by a single node. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 form one triangle, while Nodes 1, 3, and 4 form another. Node 1 connects both triangles, making it a central node.
    2. Nodes 2 and 4 are not directly connected but share Node 1 as a common neighbor. Both have similar roles as peripheral nodes linked through Node 1.
    3. Connecting Nodes 2 and 4 would bridge these triangle structures and provide redundancy in paths between other nodes, reflecting a natural completion of the graph pattern by forming a complete graph (K4).
    4. The expected impact of adding this edge includes increased robustness and connectivity. It would create a fully connected subgraph, enhancing communication pathways and potential network flow within the structure."
