    "nodes_prediction": [1, 2],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph's structure, nodes 1 and 2 appear to be part of a natural square/quadrilateral formation with nodes 3 and 4. Currently, there are connections forming three sides of this quadrilateral (1-4, 4-3, and 2-3), plus a diagonal (1-3). Adding an edge between nodes 1 and 2 would complete this symmetric structure and create a more balanced graph topology. This connection would also increase the graph's overall resilience by adding an alternative path between these nodes that currently requires going through node 3."
