    "nodes_prediction": [2, 3],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 3 are both connected to node 1, indicating they share a common connection. Adding an edge between them would create a triangular substructure, which is a common structural pattern often seen in graphs to indicate close relationships and improve connectivity. This would enhance the overall cohesion and robustness of the network."
