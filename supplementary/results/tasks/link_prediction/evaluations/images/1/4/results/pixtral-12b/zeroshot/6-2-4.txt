    "nodes_prediction": [3, 4],
    "analysis": "The nodes 3 and 4 should be logically connected as they both share a common neighbor, node 1. This connection aligns with the structural pattern observed in the graph, where connecting nodes through a common neighbor typically forms a more unified and cohesive network structure."
