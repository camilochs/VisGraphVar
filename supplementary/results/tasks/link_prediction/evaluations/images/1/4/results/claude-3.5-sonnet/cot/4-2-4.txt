    "analysis": "
    1. Structural patterns:
    - The graph shows a diamond-like structure with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4
    - Current edges form a cycle: 1-2-3-4-1
    - Node 3 has an additional diagonal connection to node 1
    - Most nodes have degree 2 or 3
    
    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 are the only non-adjacent pair that share two common neighbors (nodes 1 and 3)
    - This pair has the highest number of common neighbors among all non-connected pairs
    - Both nodes are positioned at opposite corners of the diamond structure
    
    3. Topological fit:
    - Adding edge 2-4 would complete the graph's symmetry
    - It would create two triangular substructures (2-3-4 and 1-2-4)
    - This matches the existing triangular pattern (1-2-3 and 1-3-4)
    
    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the graph's clustering coefficient
    - Would create redundant paths, improving network resilience
    - Would maintain the graph's balanced structure
    - Would result in all nodes having equal degree (3)"
