    "nodes_prediction": [1, 4],
    "analysis": "Nodes 1 and 4 should be connected because they are currently the only two nodes that are not directly connected to each other. By adding an edge between nodes 1 and 4, the graph would become fully connected, allowing for a single path to exist between any two nodes. This would enhance the overall connectivity and structure of the graph, maintaining the principle that all nodes should be reachable from each other."
