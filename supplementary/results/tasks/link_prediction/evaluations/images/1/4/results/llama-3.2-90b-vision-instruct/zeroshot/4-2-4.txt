The final answer is:

```json
{
    "nodes_prediction": [2,3],
    "analysis": "The nodes 2 and 3 might be connected in a graph due to various internal and external factors such as similarity, correlation, mutual information and semantic relations because of how they are represented in the graph. Other than that Node 2 is connected to the node 1 and Node 1 is connected to Node. Therefore it can be deduced that node 3 and 2 are actually connected through a transitive relationship."
