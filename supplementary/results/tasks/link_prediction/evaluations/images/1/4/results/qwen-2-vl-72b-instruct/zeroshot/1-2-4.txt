    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 4 should be connected based on the graph's structure. Currently, nodes 1 and 3 are connected, and each of them has an edge to nodes 2 and 4. This suggests a pattern where nodes 1 and 3 are connected to nodes 2 and 4 independently. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete the pattern and maintain the symmetry of the graph."
