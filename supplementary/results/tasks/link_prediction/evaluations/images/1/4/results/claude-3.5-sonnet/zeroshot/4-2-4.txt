    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "The graph appears to be almost cyclical in nature, with nodes 1, 3, and 4 forming triangular connections, and node 2 connected to nodes 1 and 3. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete the cyclic structure and create balanced connectivity where each node would have three connections. This would enhance the graph's symmetry and create an additional triangular substructure, making the overall topology more uniform and robust."
