    "analysis": "Detailed step-by-step explanation of:
    1. The structural patterns you identified: In the given graph, we observe that nodes 1 and 4 are highly connected to nodes 2 and 3, suggesting that they act as central nodes in the network. There are no direct connections between nodes 2 and 3, which indicates a potential structural hole.
    2. Why these specific nodes were selected: Nodes 2 and 3 have a high number of common neighbors (nodes 1 and 4), which suggests a high similarity in their connectivity patterns. Connecting them would fill the structural hole and enhance the connectivity within the network.
    3. How this connection fits the graph's topology: Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 3 would maintain the graph's natural patterns by bridging the structural hole. It would create a more connected network and enhance the information flow between the nodes.
    4. The expected impact of adding this edge: By connecting nodes 2 and 3, we expect to improve the overall connectivity of the network, reduce the distance between nodes, and potentially increase the resilience of the network against removal of nodes or edges."
