    1. Structural patterns identified:
       - The graph shows a small network of 4 nodes with 5 edges
       - There's a triangular structure between nodes 1, 2, and 3
       - Node 4 is currently connected only to node 1
       - The graph has a relatively sparse connectivity pattern
    
    2. Node selection reasoning:
       - Nodes 2 and 4 share two common neighbors (nodes 1 and 3)
       - This high number of common neighbors suggests a potential missing link
       - Both nodes have similar degrees (node 2: degree 3, node 4: degree 2)
       - Their structural positions suggest they should be connected
    
    3. Topology fit:
       - Adding this edge would create an additional triangle in the graph
       - This maintains the existing triangular pattern seen in the network
       - The new connection would balance the degree distribution
       - It follows the principle of triadic closure
    
    4. Expected impact:
       - Would increase the graph's overall clustering coefficient
       - Creates more redundant paths, potentially improving network resilience
       - Maintains the graph's natural symmetry
       - Strengthens the community structure of the network"
