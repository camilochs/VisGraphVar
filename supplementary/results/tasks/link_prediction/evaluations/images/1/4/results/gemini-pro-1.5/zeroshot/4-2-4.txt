  "nodes_prediction": [2, 3],
  "analysis": "Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.  Node 1 is connected to all other nodes. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.  The graph seems to be forming a complete graph (all nodes connected to all other nodes). Currently, nodes 2 and 3 are missing a direct connection. Adding an edge between them would move the graph closer to the complete graph structure. Since all other nodes have at least two edges, connecting 2 and 3 makes the most logical sense in terms of completing the graph and maintaining the symmetry of connections."
