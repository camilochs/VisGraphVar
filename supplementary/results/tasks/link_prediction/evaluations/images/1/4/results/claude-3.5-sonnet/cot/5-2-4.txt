    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a small network of 4 nodes with 5 edges
    - There's a triangular structure formed by nodes 1, 2, and 3
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3, forming another triangular pattern
    - The graph currently has a somewhat sparse structure with potential for increased clustering

    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 are currently not connected but share two common neighbors (nodes 1 and 3)
    - This high number of common neighbors (2 out of possible 2) suggests a strong likelihood of connection
    - Both nodes have similar degrees (node 2 has degree 2, node 4 has degree 2)
    - They are positioned in a way that completing this connection would form a natural cycle

    3. Topology fit:
    - Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete a cycle in the graph
    - This would maintain the graph's existing pattern of triangular structures
    - The connection would increase the graph's clustering coefficient
    - It follows the principle of triadic closure, a common pattern in real networks

    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the overall connectivity and resilience of the network
    - Would create a more balanced structure with equal degree distribution
    - Would form a complete subgraph among nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4
    - Would enhance the network's cohesiveness while maintaining its natural topology"
