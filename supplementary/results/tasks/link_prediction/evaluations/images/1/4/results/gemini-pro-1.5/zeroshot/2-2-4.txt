{
  "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
  "analysis": "Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3. Node 2 is connected to node 1.  Node 3 is connected to node 1.  This suggests a pattern of connection where every node is reachable by another by a maximum of 2 steps. Only nodes 2 and 4 would need to connect to fully accomplish this pattern. Connecting 2 and 4 would make every node reachable by every other node within 2 or fewer steps/edges and would complete a 4-node near-clique."
