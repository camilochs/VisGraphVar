    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. The structural patterns identified include that nodes 1, 3, and 4 form a chain-like path, and 1 connects to 2, forming a star-like topology centered around 1. Node 2 is only connected to node 1, and node 4 connects to node 3. \n2. Nodes 2 and 4 were selected because they have a structural gap that could be closed. Neither has other connections beyond their immediate neighbors. \n3. Connecting 2 and 4 fits the graph's topology by potentially integrating the two paths into a more cohesive unit, bridging a visible gap in the network. \n4. The expected impact of adding this edge would be to enhance connectivity, creating a more robust community structure in the graph, potentially enhancing communication path options between all nodes."
