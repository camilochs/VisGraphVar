    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 4 should logically be connected. Currently, these nodes are the only pair in the graph that form a path of length 2 through multiple different intermediate nodes (through node 1 and through node 3), suggesting a 'strong' indirect relationship. Following the principle of transitivity and the graph's apparent tendency to form triangular structures, adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete another triangle and strengthen the overall connectivity pattern of the graph."
