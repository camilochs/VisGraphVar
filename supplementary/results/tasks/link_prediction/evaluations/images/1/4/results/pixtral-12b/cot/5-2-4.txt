    "nodes_prediction": [1, 4],
    "analysis": "1. The structural patterns identified:
    - The graph is relatively sparse with the central part being more connected.
    - Node 1 and node 2 are highly connected, forming a potential backbone.
    - Node 3 has two connections to nodes 1 and 2, indicating a bridging role.
    - Node 4 is isolated with a single connection to node 1.

    2. Why these specific nodes were selected:
    - Node 4 is isolated and connecting it to another node can create a bridge.
    - Nodes 1 and 4 share only one connection but connecting them enhances the overall connectivity.

    3. How this connection fits the graph's topology:
    - It would fill a structural hole, linking an isolated node to the central network.
    - This helps distribute information or resource flow more evenly through the graph.

    4. The expected impact of adding this edge:
    - Improved functionality and redundancy, potentially increasing the robustness of the network.
    - Better network cohesion, leading to quicker and more reliable data transfer."
