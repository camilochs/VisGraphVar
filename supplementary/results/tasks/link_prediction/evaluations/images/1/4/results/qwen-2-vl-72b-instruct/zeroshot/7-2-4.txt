    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Based on the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 4 are the only two nodes that are not directly connected. Considering the connectivity patterns, it seems logical that node 4, which is already connected to nodes 1 and 3, should also connect to node 2 to maintain a balanced and symmetrical network topology."
