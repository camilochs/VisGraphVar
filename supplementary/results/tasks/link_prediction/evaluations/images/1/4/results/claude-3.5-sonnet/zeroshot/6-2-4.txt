    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 4 should logically be connected to complete a cycle. Currently, the graph forms an almost-complete diamond shape with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4, but it's missing the edge between nodes 2 and 4. Adding this edge would create better symmetry and resilience in the network, as it would ensure that each node has at least three connections and would complete the diamond pattern that seems to be the underlying structure of this graph."
