Based on the graph structure and topology, nodes 1 and 5 appear to be "orphans"; they do not share any common neighbors or edges. 

However, graph comparison shows that nodes 1 and 6 share two common neighbors (2 and 4), and that (1), (2), (4), and (6) form a diamond shape. Nodes 5 and 6 share a common neighbor (2) and (5), (2), (4), and (6) also form a diamond shape. It would make sense to draw an edge between (1) and (5) to complete the diamond and match the structural patterns found elsewhere in the graph.

Here is a prediction of two currently unconnected nodes that should logically be connected with an edge:
```json
{
    "nodes_prediction": [1, 5],
    "analysis": "Nodes (1) and (5) should be connected with an edge to complete the graph's triangle and diamond structural patterns."
}
```
