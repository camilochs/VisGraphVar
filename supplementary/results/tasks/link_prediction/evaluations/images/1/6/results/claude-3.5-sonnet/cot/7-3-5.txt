    "nodes_prediction": [3, 5],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a relatively dense interconnected structure
    - Most nodes have connections to 3-4 other nodes
    - There appears to be a tendency toward triangular formations
    - Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6 form a central diamond-like structure
    
    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 3 and 5 share multiple common neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 4)
    - Both nodes have similar degrees (node 3 connects to 4 nodes, node 5 connects to 4 nodes)
    - This pair has one of the highest numbers of common neighbors among unconnected pairs
    - Their connection would complete several new triangular patterns
    
    3. Topology fit:
    - Adding this edge would maintain the graph's tendency toward triangular formations
    - The connection would preserve the graph's overall density pattern
    - It would create a more balanced structure by evening out the distribution of connections
    
    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase local clustering coefficient
    - Creates multiple new triangular cycles, consistent with existing patterns
    - Improves the graph's overall connectivity and resilience
    - Maintains the natural community structure while strengthening it"
