    "nodes_prediction": [3, 6],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with most nodes having 4-5 connections
    - There's a tendency for nodes to form triangular patterns (triangular motifs)
    - The graph has a roughly circular layout with connections across the diameter
    - Node 1 and 2 appear to be hub-like nodes with high degree centrality

    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 3 and 6 share multiple common neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 5)
    - This pair has high structural similarity due to their similar connectivity patterns
    - They are positioned in a way that suggests a missing connection based on the graph's overall density
    - Both nodes have similar degree centrality (4-5 connections each)

    3. Topology fit:
    - Adding an edge between nodes 3 and 6 would:
    - Complete several new triangular motifs, consistent with the graph's pattern
    - Maintain the balanced degree distribution
    - Preserve the graph's symmetric nature
    - Follow the existing pattern of cross-diameter connections

    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase local clustering coefficient
    - Create more alternative paths between nodes
    - Enhance the graph's overall robustness
    - Maintain the natural community structure while adding useful redundancy"
