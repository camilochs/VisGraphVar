    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 5 are located at opposite corners of the graph and currently do not have any direct connections between them. Adding an edge between these nodes would create a more balanced and symmetrical structure, mirroring the pattern seen in the connections between nodes 3 and 4. This new edge would also increase the overall connectivity of the graph, making it more efficient for traversing between nodes."
