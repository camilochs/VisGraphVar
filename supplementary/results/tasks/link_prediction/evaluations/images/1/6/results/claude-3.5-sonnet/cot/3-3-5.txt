    "nodes_prediction": [3, 5],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with most nodes having multiple connections
    - There appears to be triangular patterns throughout the graph
    - Most nodes have a degree of 4-5 connections
    - The graph has a somewhat symmetrical structure
    
    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 3 and 5 are currently not connected
    - They share multiple common neighbors (nodes 4 and 6)
    - Both nodes have similar degrees (node 3 has 4 connections, node 5 has 4 connections)
    - This missing connection creates a noticeable structural hole in the graph
    
    3. Topology fit:
    - Adding this edge would complete additional triangular patterns consistent with the rest of the graph
    - The connection would maintain the graph's overall symmetry
    - It would create a more uniform degree distribution among nodes
    - The new edge follows the existing pattern of nodes having multiple paths to reach other nodes
    
    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the graph's overall clustering coefficient
    - Would improve the network's resilience by adding an alternative path
    - Would maintain the graph's natural community structure
    - Would create a more balanced distribution of connections across the network"
