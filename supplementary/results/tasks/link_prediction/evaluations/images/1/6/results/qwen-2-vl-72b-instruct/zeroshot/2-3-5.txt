    "nodes_prediction": [3, 5],
    "analysis": "The graph is nearly symmetrical with a central node (4) and six nodes evenly distributed around it. Nodes 3 and 5 are the only two pairs of nodes that are not directly connected by an edge but are already connected to all other nodes. This suggests a symmetrical pattern where every node should ideally be connected to every other node."
