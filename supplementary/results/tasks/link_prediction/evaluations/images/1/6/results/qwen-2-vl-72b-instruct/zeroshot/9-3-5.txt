    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "Node 2 and node 5 are currently not directly connected. However, they are both connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4. Given the graph's structure, where most nodes are interconnected with multiple neighbors, adding an edge between node 2 and node 5 would create a more symmetrical and balanced layout, enhancing the overall connectivity and structure of the graph."
