    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
        - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with multiple triangular formations
        - Most nodes have connections to at least 4 other nodes
        - There's a pattern of nodes forming complete or near-complete subgraphs
        - Node degrees range from 4 to 5 connections per node

    2. Node selection reasoning:
        - Nodes 2 and 5 share multiple common neighbors (1, 4, and 6)
        - These nodes are the only pair with 3 common neighbors that aren't directly connected
        - Both nodes are well-integrated into the graph's structure
        - Their connection would complete multiple additional triangles

    3. Topological fit:
        - Adding this edge would maintain the graph's pattern of dense triangular formations
        - The connection would enhance the graph's overall symmetry
        - It follows the existing pattern where nodes with multiple common neighbors are typically connected
        - The new edge would maintain the characteristic path length similar to other parts of the graph

    4. Expected impact:
        - Would increase the clustering coefficient of the graph
        - Creates new triangular structures that match the existing pattern
        - Strengthens the community structure
        - Improves the graph's overall connectivity while maintaining its natural topology"
