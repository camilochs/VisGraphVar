    "nodes_prediction": [2, 3],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 3 are currently not directly connected. However, they are both connected to nodes 4 and 5. Given the pattern of connections in the graph, where many nodes are interconnected through multiple edges, adding an edge between nodes 2 and 3 would maintain the structural integrity and connectivity observed in the rest of the graph."
