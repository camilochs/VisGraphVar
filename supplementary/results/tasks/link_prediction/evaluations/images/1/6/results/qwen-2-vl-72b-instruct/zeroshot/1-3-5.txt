    "nodes_prediction": [3, 4],
    "analysis": "Nodes 3 and 4 are on opposite sides of the graph and do not have a direct connection. Based on the graph's structure, where nodes are connected to form a complete graph, it seems logical to connect these nodes. Adding an edge between nodes 3 and 4 would complete the pattern of connectivity seen in the graph."
