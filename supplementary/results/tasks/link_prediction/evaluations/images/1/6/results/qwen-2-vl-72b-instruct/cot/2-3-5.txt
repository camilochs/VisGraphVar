    "analysis": "Detailed step-by-step explanation of:
    1. The structural patterns you identified: The graph has a dense center with nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6 having high degrees, indicating a central hub. Nodes 3 and 5 are relatively isolated, with fewer connections.
    2. Why these specific nodes were selected: Nodes 2 and 5 are both located in regions with fewer connections. Node 2 is part of the central hub but is missing a direct connection to node 5, which would create a more balanced distribution of edges.
    3. How this connection fits the graph's topology: Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 5 would bridge a structural hole and create a more balanced network structure. It would also enhance the connectivity of node 5, which currently has the lowest degree.
    4. The expected impact of adding this edge: The new edge would strengthen the overall network resilience and possibly facilitate more efficient communication between nodes. It would also maintain the graph's natural patterns by connecting regions that have fewer connections."
