    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 5 should be connected because they are the only pair of nodes that are not directly connected by an edge. Given that all other pairs of nodes are either directly connected or connected through a single intermediate node, connecting nodes 2 and 5 would complete the graph's connectivity without creating any unnecessary complexity."
