    "nodes_prediction": [4, 3],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with most nodes having multiple connections
    - There appears to be triangular patterns throughout the graph
    - Most nodes have a degree of 4 or 5
    - The graph has a somewhat symmetric structure

    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 4 and 3 share multiple common neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 6)
    - Both nodes have slightly lower degrees compared to other nodes in the graph
    - Their connection would complete several additional triangular patterns
    - They are positioned in a way that a connection between them would maintain the graph's natural geometry

    3. Topological fit:
    - The connection would maintain the graph's tendency toward triangular formations
    - It would balance the degree distribution among nodes
    - The new edge would preserve the graph's overall symmetry
    - It follows the pattern of nodes typically connecting to others with multiple common neighbors

    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase local clustering coefficient
    - Creates additional triangular cycles, strengthening the graph's cohesion
    - Improves the graph's overall connectivity without creating unusual structural patterns
    - Maintains the natural density pattern observed in the rest of the graph"
