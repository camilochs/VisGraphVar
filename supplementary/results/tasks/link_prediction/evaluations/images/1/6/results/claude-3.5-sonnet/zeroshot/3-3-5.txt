    "nodes_prediction": [3, 5],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph structure, nodes 3 and 5 should logically be connected. This prediction is based on several observations: (1) The graph shows a pattern of triangular formations and high connectivity between most nodes, (2) Most nodes have connections to at least 4 other nodes, creating a relatively dense network, (3) Nodes 3 and 5 are both connected to nodes 4 and 6, suggesting they are part of the same cluster or community within the graph. Adding an edge between nodes 3 and 5 would complete another triangular formation and maintain the graph's overall structural symmetry and connectivity patterns."
