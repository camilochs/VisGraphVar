    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 5 should be connected because they are part of the same cluster that includes nodes 1, 3, and 4. Node 5 is already connected to nodes 1 and 3, and node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4. Connecting nodes 2 and 5 would complete the cluster and maintain the balance of connections within the cluster."
