    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 5 are both connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6, indicating that they share similar connectivity patterns within the graph. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 5 would help maintain the balance and symmetry observed in the graph, as nodes 1 and 4 share a connection with all other nodes, and nodes 3 and 6 share a connection with all nodes except nodes 2 and 5, respectively. This addition would also create a more even distribution of connections across the graph."
