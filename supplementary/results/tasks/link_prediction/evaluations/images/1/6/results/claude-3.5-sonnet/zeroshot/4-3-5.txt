    "nodes_prediction": [3, 6],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph structure, nodes 3 and 6 should logically be connected. This prediction is based on several observations: (1) The graph shows a high degree of connectivity between most nodes, approaching a complete graph, (2) Most vertices have connections to 4-5 other nodes, (3) Nodes 3 and 6 are currently connected to many common neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 5), suggesting they are part of the same tight cluster. Adding this edge would maintain the graph's dense connectivity pattern and complete the local cluster structure."
