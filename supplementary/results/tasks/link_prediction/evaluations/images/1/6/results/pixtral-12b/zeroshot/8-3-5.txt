    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 5 are neither directly connected nor indirectly connected through other nodes in the existing graph. Connecting them would create a direct link between two nodes that currently have no paths between them, potentially improving the graph's connectivity and balancing the structure."
