    "nodes_prediction": [1, 5],
    "analysis": "1. The structural patterns identified:
    - Node 1 is directly connected to nodes 2 and 6.
    - Node 5 is directly connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.

    2. Why these specific nodes were selected:
    - Node 1 is positioned near the lower part of the graph, with connections primarily in the bottom right quadrant.
    - Node 5 is positioned in the middle-left of the graph, bridging connections towards nodes 2 and 3.

    3. How this connection fits the graph's topology:
    - Connecting nodes 1 and 5 would enhance the vertical connectivity of the graph, creating a stronger link between the upper right and lower left sections.
    - This link would provide additional pathways, particularly from node 2, through nodes 1 and 5, linking to other parts of the graph.

    4. The expected impact of adding this edge:
    - It increases the graph's robustness and efficiency by bridging different clusters.
    - It facilitates better network flow and overall connectivity, potentially improving the graph's resilience to disruptions.
