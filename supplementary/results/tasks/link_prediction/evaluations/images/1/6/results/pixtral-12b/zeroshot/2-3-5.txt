    "nodes_prediction": [1, 5],
    "analysis": "Node 1 is currently connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4, but not to node 5. Similarly, node 5 is connected to node 4 but lacks a direct connection to node 1. Given the symmetric structure and same-degree connectivity of the graph, adding an edge between node 1 and node 5 would maintain the balance and symmetry, ensuring an even distribution of connections across the nodes."
