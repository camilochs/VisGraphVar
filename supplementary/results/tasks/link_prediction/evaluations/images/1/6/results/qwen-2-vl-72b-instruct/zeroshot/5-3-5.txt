    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 5 should be connected because they are both currently isolated from the main cluster of nodes in the graph. By connecting node 2 to node 5, it would create a more cohesive and interconnected structure, reducing the isolation of both nodes and potentially improving the overall connectivity and balance of the graph."
