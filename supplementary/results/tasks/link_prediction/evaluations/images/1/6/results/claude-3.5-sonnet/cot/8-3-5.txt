    1. Structural patterns identified:
       - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with most nodes having 3-4 connections
       - There's a triangular pattern repeated throughout (1-2-4, 1-2-5, 2-4-6, etc.)
       - The graph appears to have a balanced distribution of edges with no isolated components
       - Nodes 1, 2, and 6 appear to be hub-like with higher degrees

    2. Node selection reasoning:
       - Nodes 3 and 5 share multiple common neighbors (1, 2, and 6)
       - Both nodes have similar structural positions in the graph
       - This is one of the few node pairs with many common neighbors but no direct connection
       - The absence of this edge creates a structural hole in what would otherwise be a complete subgraph

    3. Topological fit:
       - Adding this edge would maintain the graph's symmetrical nature
       - It would complete several additional triangular patterns, which are common in the existing structure
       - The connection follows the graph's pattern of nodes typically connecting to others with multiple common neighbors

    4. Expected impact:
       - Would increase local clustering coefficient
       - Creates additional triangular closures, strengthening the community structure
       - Improves the graph's overall connectivity without disrupting existing patterns
       - Maintains the balanced nature of edge distribution"
