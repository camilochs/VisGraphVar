  "nodes_prediction": [1, 2],
  "analysis": "Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.  Following the pattern, nodes 1 and 2 should also be connected to complete the symmetry and connectivity of the graph. Every other node pair is connected, creating a somewhat clique-like behavior. With an edge between 1 and 2, everyone would at least be two steps away from any other node."
