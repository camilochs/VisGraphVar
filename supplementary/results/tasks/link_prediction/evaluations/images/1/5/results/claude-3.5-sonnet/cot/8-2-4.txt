    1. Structural patterns:
    - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with 5 nodes
    - Most nodes have connections to 3-4 other nodes
    - There's a roughly pentagonal shape with cross-connections
    - Node 2 and Node 4 are notably less connected to each other compared to other node pairs
    
    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 share multiple common neighbors (nodes 1 and 3)
    - They are positioned in a way that creates a structural hole in the graph
    - Both nodes have similar degrees (node 2: 3 connections, node 4: 3 connections)
    - Their connection would complete a natural triangular pattern with their common neighbors
    
    3. Topological fit:
    - Adding this edge would maintain the graph's overall symmetry
    - It would create additional triangular structures, which are common in the existing topology
    - The connection follows the pattern of other nodes having 4 connections each
    
    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the graph's overall density and resilience
    - Creates more alternative paths between nodes
    - Balances the degree distribution among nodes
    - Completes several potential triangular cycles, which are prevalent in the existing structure"
