To determine which nodes should logically be connected based on the structure of the graph, we observe the existing connections and the positions of the nodes. Given this, we suggest connecting nodes 1 and 2 directly, as this connection aligns with the overall symmetric pattern of the graph.

Here is the JSON object with the prediction:

```json
{
    "nodes_prediction": [1, 2],
    "analysis": "Node 1 and node 2 are currently not directly connected, but they are both strongly connected to nodes 3 and 5, suggesting that adding a direct edge between them would extend the highly interconnected nature of the graph while maintaining symmetry. This connection mirrors the existing edge patterns and enhances the overall connectivity and balance in the graph."
