    "nodes_prediction": [1, 4],
    "analysis": "Nodes 1 and 4 should be connected because there is a clear path between them through nodes 3 and 5. Adding an edge directly from node 1 to node 4 would create a more balanced and symmetrical structure in the graph, reducing the number of longer paths and potentially simplifying algorithms that traverse it."
