  "nodes_prediction": [4, 2],
  "analysis": "Node 5 is connected to all other nodes. Nodes 1 and 3 are also interconnected amongst the rest.  Observing the connecting pattern, nodes 4 and 2 are the only remaining nodes without a direct connection, suggesting a missing edge between them to complete a more balanced structure. Adding an edge between 4 and 2 makes the graph more symmetrical and consistent with the existing connections."
