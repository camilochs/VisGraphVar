    "nodes_prediction": [1, 4],
    "analysis": "1. Structural Patterns:
    - The graph shows a relatively dense network with 5 nodes
    - Most nodes have connections to 3-4 other nodes
    - There's a triangular pattern repeated throughout (1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, etc.)
    - The graph has a roughly circular layout with cross-connections

    2. Node Selection Reasoning:
    - Nodes 1 and 4 are the only pair that share multiple common neighbors (nodes 2, 3, and 5)
    - Both nodes have similar degrees (node 1 has 4 connections, node 4 has 4 connections)
    - Their connection would complete a natural symmetry in the graph
    - They have the highest number of common neighbors among unconnected pairs

    3. Topological Fit:
    - Adding this edge would maintain the graph's existing pattern of triangular formations
    - It would create a more balanced degree distribution
    - The connection follows the natural geometry of the current layout
    - It would reinforce the existing community structure

    4. Expected Impact:
    - Would increase the graph's clustering coefficient
    - Creates additional triangular closures
    - Improves the overall network resilience
    - Maintains the graph's natural symmetry while increasing connectivity"
