    "nodes_prediction": [4, 2],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a relatively sparse structure with 5 nodes
    - There appears to be a triangular pattern (1-3-5, 1-4-3, 2-3-5)
    - Node 3 acts as a central hub with high degree centrality
    - Most nodes have connections to at least 3 other nodes
    
    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 4 and 2 are currently not connected but share two common neighbors (nodes 3 and 5)
    - Both nodes have similar degrees (4 has degree 3, 2 has degree 3)
    - They are positioned in a way that suggests a missing connection
    - The absence of this edge creates a structural hole in the graph
    
    3. Topological fit:
    - Adding this edge would complete another triangle in the graph (4-2-3)
    - This maintains the observed pattern of triangular structures
    - The connection would increase the graph's overall density in a balanced way
    - It follows the existing pattern of nodes having 3-4 connections
    
    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the graph's clustering coefficient
    - Creates more redundant paths, potentially improving network resilience
    - Maintains the graph's symmetric nature
    - Strengthens the overall connectivity without creating unusual structural patterns"
