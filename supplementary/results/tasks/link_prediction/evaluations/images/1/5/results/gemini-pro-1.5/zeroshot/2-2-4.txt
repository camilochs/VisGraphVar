  "nodes_prediction": [1, 2],
  "analysis": "Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.  Connecting nodes 1 and 2 would complete a more symmetrical and interconnected structure, reflecting a pattern of connectivity among the nodes in the graph. Specifically, every node would then be connected to either three or four other nodes. Furthermore, without the (1,2) edge, nodes 3 and 5 are degree-3 nodes, whereas adding the (1,2) edge would make all nodes save for node 4 have degree 3."
