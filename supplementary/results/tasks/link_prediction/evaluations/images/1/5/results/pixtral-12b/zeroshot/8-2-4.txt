    "nodes_prediction": [3, 2],
    "analysis": "Based on the graph's structure, nodes 3 and 2 are currently not connected. However, they both have multiple connections to other central nodes such as 1 and 5. Adding an edge between nodes 3 and 2 completes the connectivity between these central nodes and ensures a more robust and interconnected network, enhancing the overall integrity and symmetry of the graph."
