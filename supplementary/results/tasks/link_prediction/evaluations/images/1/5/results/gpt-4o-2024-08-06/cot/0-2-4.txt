    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. The structural patterns you identified:
    - The graph includes a dense cluster where most nodes are interconnected, resembling a nearly complete graph.
    - Nodes 2 and 4 do not have a direct connection but are part of the same dense community.
    
    2. Why these specific nodes were selected:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 share three common neighbors (1, 3, 5), indicating a high level of shared connectivity.
    - Both nodes have similar degrees, contributing to the balance of the community.

    3. How this connection fits the graph's topology:
    - Adding an edge between 2 and 4 would complete the interconnection within the dense cluster, maintaining the graph's uniform pattern.

    4. The expected impact of adding this edge:
    - The new edge would strengthen the overall cohesiveness of the graph by enhancing the connectivity between nodes that are already close in proximity.
    - It would eliminate any structural hole, ensuring robustness and completeness within the community."
