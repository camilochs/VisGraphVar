    1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with 5 nodes
    - Most nodes have 3-4 connections
    - There's a triangular pattern repeated multiple times (1-3-5, 1-2-5, etc.)
    - Node 5 acts as a central connector, having edges with all nodes except node 2

    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 are the only pair of nodes that share multiple common neighbors (nodes 1, 3, and 5) but aren't directly connected
    - Both nodes have similar degree centrality (node 2 has 3 connections, node 4 has 3 connections)
    - This missing connection creates a structural hole in what would otherwise be a complete subgraph

    3. Topological fit:
    - Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would maintain the graph's symmetric nature
    - It would complete a pattern of triangular connections that's already present in other parts of the graph
    - The connection would reinforce the existing community structure

    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the graph's clustering coefficient
    - Would enhance the network's robustness by providing an alternative path between these nodes
    - Would create additional triangular structures, matching the graph's existing patterns
    - Would maintain the balanced degree distribution among nodes"
