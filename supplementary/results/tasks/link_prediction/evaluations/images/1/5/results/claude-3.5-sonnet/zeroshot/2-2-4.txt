    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph structure, nodes 2 and 4 should logically be connected to maintain the graph's overall connectivity pattern. Most nodes in this graph have a high degree of connectivity, forming multiple triangular structures. Currently, node 2 connects to nodes 1, 3, and 5, while node 4 connects to nodes 1, 3, and 5. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete another triangular structure and maintain the graph's symmetrical nature, as most other nodes have similar degrees of connectivity. This connection would also enhance the graph's overall robustness and maintain its characteristic clustering pattern."
