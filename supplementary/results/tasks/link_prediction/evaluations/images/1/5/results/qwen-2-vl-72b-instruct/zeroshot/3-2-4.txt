    "nodes_prediction": [3, 4],
    "analysis": "Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5, while node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5. Since nodes 3 and 4 both have connections to nodes 1, 3, and 5, it would be logical to establish a direct connection between them to maintain the integrity and symmetry of the graph structure."
