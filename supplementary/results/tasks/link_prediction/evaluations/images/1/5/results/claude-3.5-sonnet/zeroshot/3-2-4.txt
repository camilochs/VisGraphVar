    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 4 should logically be connected because they are both part of what appears to be an almost complete subgraph structure. Currently, all other nodes in this region have high connectivity with each other, forming several triangular patterns. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete this pattern and maintain the graph's overall clustering coefficient. This connection would also create additional triangular cycles, which seem to be a common motif in this graph's topology."
