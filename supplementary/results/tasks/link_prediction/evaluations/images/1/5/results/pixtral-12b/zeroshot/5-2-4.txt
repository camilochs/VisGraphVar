    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "Based on the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 5 should be connected because they both have multiple connections with other nodes, indicating a higher degree of interaction. Connecting node 2 to node 5 would increase the connectivity and potentially enhance the network's photo stability."
