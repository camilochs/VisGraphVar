    "nodes_prediction": [3, 4],
    "analysis": "Based on the existing graph structure, nodes 3 and 4 are both connected to node 5 and have a tendency to form a triangular relationship. Adding an edge between nodes 3 and 4 completes a stronger connection pattern and balances the relationships established with node 5, thereby enhancing the graph's symmetry and structural integrity."
