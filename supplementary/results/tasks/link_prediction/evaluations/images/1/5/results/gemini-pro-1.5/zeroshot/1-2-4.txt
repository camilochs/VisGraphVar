  "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
  "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 4 are the only two nodes that are not directly connected.  Every other node is connected to at least three other nodes. Connecting nodes 2 and 4 would make the graph closer to a complete graph, which is a common underlying structure for this type of problem and would increase the overall connectivity and symmetry of the graph."
