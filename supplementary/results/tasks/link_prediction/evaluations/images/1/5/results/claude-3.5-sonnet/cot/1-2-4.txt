    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with 5 nodes
    - Most nodes have connections to at least 3 other nodes
    - There appears to be a tendency toward triangular formations
    - The graph has an almost complete structure except for a few missing edges

    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 share multiple common neighbors (nodes 1 and 5)
    - This pair has the highest number of common neighbors among unconnected nodes
    - Both nodes have similar degrees (node 2 has degree 3, node 4 has degree 3)
    - Their connection would complete multiple triangular formations

    3. Topological fit:
    - Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would maintain the graph's tendency toward triangular structures
    - The connection would follow the existing pattern of relatively high edge density
    - It would create a more balanced degree distribution among nodes
    - The edge would reinforce the existing community structure

    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the overall clustering coefficient
    - Creates new triangular cycles, enhancing the graph's cohesiveness
    - Improves the average path length between nodes
    - Maintains the graph's natural symmetry and balance"
