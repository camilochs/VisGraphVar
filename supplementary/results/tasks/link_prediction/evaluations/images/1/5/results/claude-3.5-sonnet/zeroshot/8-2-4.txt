    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph structure, nodes 2 and 4 should be connected based on several structural patterns. First, most nodes in this graph have high connectivity (degree 3-4), forming multiple triangular substructures. Second, nodes 2 and 4 are currently both connected to nodes 1 and 3, forming a square pattern (1-2-3-4), and in this graph's topology, such squares tend to have diagonal connections. Adding an edge between 2 and 4 would maintain the graph's density pattern and complete another triangular substructure, consistent with the graph's existing organizational principles."
