    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 4 appear to be natural candidates for connection. Most other nodes in the graph have higher connectivity, and there's a pattern of triangular formations. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete another triangle in the graph (with node 5) and would increase the overall symmetry of the network. This connection would also balance the degree distribution of the nodes, as both nodes 2 and 4 currently have relatively fewer connections compared to other nodes in the graph."
