    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Based on the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 4 should be connected because they form part of what appears to be an attempt at maximal triangulation in the graph. Most other nodes that are this close in the graph's layout share connections, and both nodes 2 and 4 are already connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5, forming a natural cycle. Adding this edge would complete a symmetric pattern and increase the graph's overall connectivity while maintaining its apparent organizational principle of triangular formations."
