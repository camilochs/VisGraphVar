To determine the unconnected nodes that should logically be connected, let's examine the graph's structure and existing patterns.

The graph displays a clear central node (node 5) connected directly to almost all other non-central nodes (nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4). There is only one edge that branches from the central node (to node 3), which is then connected to node 2, indicating a potential pattern of betweenness centrality on the part of a central "hub" node. This pattern is usually seen with wheel (or star) graphs, although this example seems inconsistent - node 5 should connect equally to all nodes if the graph is structured as a wheel graph.

Looking at the neighborhoods of the graph, we notice consistently strong relationships between peripheral node neighborhoods. Peripheral nodes within the neighborhood of the central node consistently connect to almost all other nodes in the neighborhood except one. The connectivity pattern between nodes 3, 4, 5 confirms that they all share a similar quantitative (deg >= 3) and qualitative (sociocentric centrality) centrality. For edge prediction purposes, this information allows us to infer that other connections will follow the existing pattern. As such, a similar relationship is likely to be confirmed between the remaining pairs of central nodes.

All remaining unconnected central nodes are:
* (1,3)
* (2,4)
* (3,5)
* (1,2)

However, (3,5), being in the neighborhood of node 3 and node 5, follows the design pattern set by neighboring nodes (1,3) and (4,5). Looking at their degrees, these nodes are well connected in the existing graph, suggesting that their linking creates a logarithmic growth in optional connections. This is beneficial for the future growth of the graph and so is likely to occur. Another reason is the likely reduction in graph diameter for improved graph reach. This is the network pheromonic encouragement needed for connectivity of (2,4), and (3,5). This creates a centralized probabilistic settlement on the alters with a high chance of connectivity.



Therefore we conclude: Node 3 should connect to node 5, and node 4 should connect to node 2.
