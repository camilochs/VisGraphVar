To determine which two unconnected nodes should be joined by an edge, let's follow the analytical steps outline above.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Overall Graph Structure:**
   - The graph contains 5 nodes (labeled 1 to 5) connected in a manner where not all nodes are directly linked.
   - Nodes 1, 3, and 5 form a smaller cluster or triangle.
   - Nodes 2 and 4 seem to be somewhat isolated from the core cluster with fewer connections.

2. **Degree of Connection:**
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
   - Node 2 is connected to node 4.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
   - Node 4 is connected to node 2.
   - Node 5 is connected to node 1.

3. **Common Neighbors and Structural Similarity:**
   - Node 2 shares a single connection with node 4.
   - Nodes 1, 3, and 5 have multiple connections among themselves but fewer with nodes 2 and 4.

4. **Identifying Structural Holes:**
   - Observing the graph, nodes 2 and 4 are quite isolated.
   - Connecting nodes 2 and 4 would help in bridging a structural hole and potentially bringing these nodes into the main cluster.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the two unconnected nodes that should be joined by an edge are **nodes 2 and 4**. This connection would enhance the connectivity and integrate the more isolated nodes into the primary cluster.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "The structural patterns identified show that nodes 2 and 4 are relatively isolated with only one connection each. By connecting nodes 2 and 4, we bridge a structural hole and integrate these nodes into the primary cluster. This connection maintains the graph's natural patterns while enhancing the overall functionality and connectivity."
