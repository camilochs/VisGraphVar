    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 4 appear to be natural candidates for connection. Currently, all other nodes in the graph have multiple connections forming triangular patterns, creating a relatively dense network. Nodes 2 and 4 are both connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5, suggesting they are part of the same cluster or community. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete another triangle in the graph and maintain the consistent pattern of interconnectedness seen throughout the rest of the structure."
