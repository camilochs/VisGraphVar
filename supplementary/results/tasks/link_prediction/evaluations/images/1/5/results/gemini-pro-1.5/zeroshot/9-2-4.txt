  "nodes_prediction": [1, 2],
  "analysis": "Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.  Connecting nodes 1 and 2 would complete the symmetry and create a more cohesive structure, making it similar to a complete graph missing only the edge between nodes 1 and 2."
