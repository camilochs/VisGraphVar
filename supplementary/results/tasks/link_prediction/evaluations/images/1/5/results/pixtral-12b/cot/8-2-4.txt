    "nodes_prediction": [4, 3],
    "analysis": "1. Structural Patterns: 
    - The graph contains a cluster involving nodes 1, 5, and 3, as well as another connected region with nodes 4 and 2.
    - Nodes 1, 5, and 3 have a higher connectivity amongst themselves.
    - Node 4 seems somewhat isolated, connected only to node 1 and 2.

    2. Why These Specific Nodes Were Selected:
    - Nodes 4 and 3 are in different regions of the graph.
    - Adding an edge between 4 and 3 would bridge the structural gap, improving connectivity between these two areas.

    3. How This Connection Fits the Graphâ€™s Topology:
    - Connecting nodes 4 and 3 will complete the cycle involving nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without introducing imbalance.
    - The addition enhances the graph, ensuring a more robust and dense connectivity.

    4. Expected Impact of Adding This Edge:
    - Enhanced the bridge connecting two distinct regions.
    - Improves overall network resilience and potential information flow between isolated clusters."
