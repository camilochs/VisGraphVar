    "nodes_prediction": [2, 3],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 3 are currently not directly connected. Given the structure where most nodes are part of a complete subgraph or nearly complete subgraph, connecting nodes 2 and 3 would improve the graph's cohesiveness and symmetry, allowing better flow and interaction between these two parts of the graph."
