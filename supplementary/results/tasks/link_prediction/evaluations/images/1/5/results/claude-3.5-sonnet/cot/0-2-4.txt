    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "1. Structural patterns identified:
    - The graph shows a nearly complete structure with 5 nodes
    - Most nodes have high degree (3-4 connections)
    - There's a roughly pentagonal shape with cross-connections
    - Nodes 2 and 4 are the only pair of non-adjacent nodes that share multiple common neighbors

    2. Node selection reasoning:
    - Nodes 2 and 4 share three common neighbors (nodes 1, 3, and 5)
    - This high number of common neighbors suggests a strong structural similarity
    - All other non-connected node pairs have fewer common neighbors
    - The missing connection between 2 and 4 creates a structural hole in an otherwise well-connected graph

    3. Topological fit:
    - Adding this edge would complete a balanced structure
    - It maintains the graph's pattern of high connectivity
    - The connection would create additional triangles, which are common in the existing structure
    - It follows the graph's tendency toward high clustering

    4. Expected impact:
    - Would increase the graph's overall density and clustering coefficient
    - Creates more balanced degree distribution (all nodes would have degree 4)
    - Enhances the graph's robustness by adding redundant paths
    - Completes multiple additional triangular structures, reinforcing the community structure"
