    "nodes_prediction": [2, 5],
    "analysis": "In the given graph, nodes 2 and 5 are the only two nodes that are not directly connected by an edge. All other nodes have at least one direct connection to other nodes. Connecting nodes 2 and 5 would enhance the connectivity within the graph, making it more balanced and integrated."
