    "nodes_prediction": [3, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph's structure, nodes 3 and 4 appear to be logical candidates for a new connection. Currently, these nodes share multiple common neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 5), forming a pattern of triangular connections throughout the graph. Adding an edge between nodes 3 and 4 would maintain this triangular pattern and increase the graph's overall connectivity and symmetry. This connection would complete a natural cycle in the graph's topology."
