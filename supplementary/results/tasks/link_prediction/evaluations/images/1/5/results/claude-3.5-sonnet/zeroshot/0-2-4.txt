    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph structure, nodes 2 and 4 are the only pair of nodes not directly connected, while both have connections to nodes 1, 3, and 5. This creates an asymmetry in what otherwise appears to be a highly connected graph. Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would complete the graph's dense connectivity pattern and maintain the structural balance, as every other node pair has a direct connection. This addition would also create additional triangular formations consistent with the existing pattern in the graph."
