    1. Structural patterns identified:
        - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with 5 nodes
        - Most nodes have 3-4 connections
        - There's a rough triangular pattern between nodes 1, 3, and 5
        - Node 4 and node 2 are currently the most distant from each other

    2. Node selection reasoning:
        - Nodes 2 and 4 share multiple common neighbors (nodes 3 and 5)
        - Their connection would complete a balanced structure
        - Both nodes have similar degrees (3 connections each)
        - They are the only node pair with multiple common neighbors that aren't directly connected

    3. Topological fit:
        - Adding this edge would create additional triangular patterns, which are common in the existing structure
        - It would maintain the graph's overall density pattern
        - The connection would enhance the graph's symmetry
        - It follows the existing pattern of nodes having 3-4 connections

    4. Expected impact:
        - Would increase the graph's overall connectivity
        - Creates more efficient paths between nodes
        - Enhances the network's resilience by adding redundant paths
        - Maintains the balanced degree distribution while completing natural structural patterns
