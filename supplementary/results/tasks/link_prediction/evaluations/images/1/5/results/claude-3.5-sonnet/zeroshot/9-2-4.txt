    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Looking at the graph's structure, nodes 2 and 4 should logically be connected. Currently, they are both well-connected to other nodes (nodes 1, 3, and 5) but lack a direct connection to each other. Adding this edge would complete a more balanced network topology, as most other nodes in the graph have direct connections to their neighbors. This connection would also create additional triangular patterns (2-4-1, 2-4-3, and 2-4-5) which are prevalent in the existing structure, suggesting this is a natural organizational principle of this graph."
