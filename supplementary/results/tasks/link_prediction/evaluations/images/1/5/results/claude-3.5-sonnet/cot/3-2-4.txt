    1. Structural patterns identified:
        - The graph shows a relatively dense structure with 5 nodes
        - Node 5 and node 1 appear to be high-degree nodes (hubs)
        - The graph forms a somewhat circular structure with multiple triangular formations
        - Most nodes have connections to at least 3 other nodes
    
    2. Node selection reasoning:
        - Nodes 2 and 4 share multiple common neighbors (nodes 1, 3, and 5)
        - They are the only pair of nodes with 3 common neighbors that aren't directly connected
        - Their structural positions are similar (both are peripheral nodes connected to hubs)
    
    3. Topological fit:
        - Adding this edge would complete a natural cycle in the graph
        - It would maintain the graph's symmetrical nature
        - The connection would reinforce the existing triangular patterns
        - It follows the pattern of nodes having similar degrees
    
    4. Expected impact:
        - Would increase the graph's overall clustering coefficient
        - Creates additional triangular structures, strengthening local connectivity
        - Improves the graph's resilience by adding an alternative path
        - Maintains the balanced degree distribution among nodes"
