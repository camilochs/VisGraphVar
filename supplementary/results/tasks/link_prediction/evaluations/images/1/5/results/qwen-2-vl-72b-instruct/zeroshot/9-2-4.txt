    "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
    "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 4 are currently unconnected, but they are adjacent to many common nodes (1, 3, and 5). Adding an edge between nodes 2 and 4 would create a more balanced and symmetric graph structure, similar to the existing connections seen with other nodes. This connection would also balance the number of connections coming in and out of each node, maintaining a consistent connectivity pattern throughout the graph."
