    "nodes_prediction": [3, 4],
    "analysis": "The graph appears to be aiming for a complete connection pattern where each node is linked with every other node. Nodes 3 and 4 are the only ones not directly connected to each other, forming the only missing link in achieving a complete graph (K5). Connecting these nodes would maintain the structural consistency of a fully connected network."
