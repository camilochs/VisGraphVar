  "nodes_prediction": [2, 4],
  "analysis": "Nodes 2 and 4 share similar connectivity patterns with nodes 1, 3, and 5.  Node 1 is connected to all other nodes, and Nodes 3 and 5 are connected to each of 1, 2, and 4.  Adding an edge between 2 and 4 makes the graph more symmetric and consistent with the overall pattern of interconnectedness. It makes node 2’s connectivity similar to that of node 5 (and symmetrically, node 4‘s connectivity similar to node 3)."
