**Graph Classification**

To classify the graph, we need to analyze its structure and properties.

**Properties of the Graph**

*   The graph has **7 vertices** (A, B, C, D, E, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
*   There are **15 edges** connecting these vertices.
*   The graph contains **no isolated vertices**.
*   There are **no self-loops**.
*   The graph is **connected** (all vertices are reachable from each other).
*   There are **no multiple edges** between any two vertices.

**Classification**

Based on the properties observed, the graph can be classified into one of the known types:

*   **Acyclic Graph**: A graph with no cycles. Since there are no cycles in this graph, it is acyclic.
*   **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. This graph does not satisfy this condition.
*   **Complete Graph**: A graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This graph does not satisfy this condition.
*   **Cyclic Graph**: A graph containing at least one cycle. This graph does not contain any cycles.
*   **Mesh Graph**: Also known as a lattice graph, it is an undirected graph whose vertices consist of a set of grid points arranged in a square lattice pattern and where two vertices are connected by an edge if their distance is one (in other words, they are neighbors in the lattice.) This graph does not satisfy this condition.
*   **Planar Graph**: A graph that can be embedded in the plane, i.e., it can be drawn on a piece of paper in such a way that no edges intersect except at their endpoints. Graphs with less than 5 vertices or graphs in which any two cycles have no common edges are planar. However, graph with 7 nodes and 15 edges cannot be planar
*   **Tree Graph**: An acyclic connected graph. Since the graph is both connected and acyclic, it satisfies the condition of being a tree.

**Conclusion**

The graph can be classified into the following categories:

*   **Acyclic**: As there are no cycles in the graph.
*   **Tree**: As it is both connected and acyclic.
