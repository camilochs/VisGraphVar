Certainly! Below is the JSON classification of the graph shown in the image:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "completeite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a completeite graph."
}
```

### Analysis:
1. ** acyclic**: The graph contains cycles, hence it is not acyclic.
2. **bipartite**: The graph can be divided into two sets where every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other. Given the clear partition between vertices (on the left in blue and right in green), it isite.
3. **complete**: For a graph to be complete, every vertex should be connected to every other vertex. However, in this graph, there are certain pairs of vertices that are not connected, so it is not a complete graph.
4. **cyclic**: The graph contains cycles, therefore it is a cyclic graph.
5. **mesh**: A mesh graph implies a regular, lattice-like structure, which this graph does not resemble.
6. **planar**: This particular graph likely does not fit the criteria of being planar as it does not submit to a flat surface drawing without edges crossing.
7. **tree**: A tree is a connected acyclic graph, which this graph is not.

Considering the observations above, the graph shown in the image best fits the classification of a completeite graph.
