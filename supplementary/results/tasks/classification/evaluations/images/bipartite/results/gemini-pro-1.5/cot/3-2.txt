  "type_graph": "bipartite",
  "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets (A, B, C, D, E and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) such that all edges connect vertices from one set to the other, and no edges connect vertices within the same set. It is not a complete bipartite graph because not every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set.  The graph is also planar because it can be redrawn without any edge crossings, and it is acyclic because it contains no cycles."
