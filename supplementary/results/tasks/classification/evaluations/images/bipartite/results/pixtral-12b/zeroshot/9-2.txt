The graph visualization shown in the image can be classified as a bipartite graph. Here is the analysis in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph."
}
```

**Reasoning:**
- **Bipartite Graph:** A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. 
- In the image, vertices on the left (labeled A, B, C, D, E) are all connected to vertices on the right (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), satisfying the conditions of a bipartite graph.
