  "type_graph": "bipartite",
  "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets (A, B, C, D, E and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. It is not complete because not all vertices from one set are connected to all vertices from the other set. It is acyclic because it doesn't have a closed path. It's also planar because it can be drawn without edge crossings with some rearrangement."
