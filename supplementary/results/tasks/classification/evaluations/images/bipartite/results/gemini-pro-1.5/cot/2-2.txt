  "type_graph": "bipartite",
  "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets (A, B, C, D, E and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. There are no edges within the same set. The graph is acyclic because it contains no cycles.  It is also planar because it can be drawn without edge crossings (as shown in the image).  It is not complete since not every vertex in the first set is connected to every vertex in the second set.  It is not a mesh or a tree either since those have different connectivity patterns."
