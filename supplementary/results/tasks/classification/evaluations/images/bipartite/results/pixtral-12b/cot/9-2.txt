Let's analyze the graph step-by-step according to the given criteria:

1. **Cycles (Cyclic/Cyclic/Planar):** 
   - By examining the image, we can determine if there are any cycles (closed paths that return to the starting vertex).
   - In this image, there are no clear cycles indicating that the graph is **acyclic**.

2. **Connectivity Pattern:**
   - Each vertex on the left (A, B, C, D, E) is connected to each vertex on the right (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
   - These connections imply aite nature where vertices can be divided into two groups, with edges only connecting vertices from different groups.
   - This indicates that the graph is **bipartite**.

3. **Edge Crossings:**
   - The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings.
   - This property further supports that the graph is **planar**.

Now, let's put this analysis into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "acyclic,ite, planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows an acyclic,ite, planar graph because each vertex on the left is connected to all vertices on the right without creating any cycles. The graph can be divided into two sets of vertices with no edges between vertices within the same set. Additionally, it can be drawn without any edge crossings, indicating it is planar."
}
```

This analysis indicates that the graph shown in the image is best classified as acyclic,ite, and planar.
