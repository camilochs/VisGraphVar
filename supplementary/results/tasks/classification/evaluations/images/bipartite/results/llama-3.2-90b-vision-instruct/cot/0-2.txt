Based on the given analysis steps, let's examine the graph:

1. **Checking for cycles**: The graph contains paths where it is possible to start at one vertex and end back at that same vertex. For example, following from A to B to C and back through D to A forms a cycle. Thus, the graph is **cyclic**.

2. **Examining connectivity and vertex organization**:
   - All vertices are not connected to all other vertices. For instance, vertices 1 and 5 do not have a direct connection.
   - There isn't an evident organization of vertices into distinct sets or a hierarchical structure based on the provided image.

3. **Looking at edge crossings**:
   - It seems it would be possible to redraw the graph without edge crossings by rearranging its layout.

Given these observations, the graph best matches the description of a cyclic graph because it contains cycles and does not meet the criteria for being complete, bipartite, mesh, or a structured hierarchical tree, but could be redrawn to be planar without edge crossings.

Here is the final classification in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles where one can start and end at the same vertex through different paths and does not have all vertices directly connected to each other."
}
```
