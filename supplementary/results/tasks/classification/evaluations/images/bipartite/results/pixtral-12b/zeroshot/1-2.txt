Based on the analysis of the graph visualization, the graph appears to beite.

```json
{
  "type_graph": "bipartite",
  "analysis": "The image shows aite graph."
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Bipartite**: A graph isite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. This graph has vertices (A, B, C, D, E) on the left and vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) on the right, and all edges connect vertices between the two sets. This indicates that the graph isite.
