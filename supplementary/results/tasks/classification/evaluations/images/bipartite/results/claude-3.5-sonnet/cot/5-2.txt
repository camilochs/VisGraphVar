   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices are clearly divided into two distinct sets (one set with vertices A-E in blue, and another set with vertices 1-5 in green), with edges only connecting vertices between these two sets and never within the same set. There are no cycles within each set, and the graph exhibits the characteristic cross-connecting pattern of bipartite graphs."
