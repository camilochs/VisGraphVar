   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices can be divided into two distinct sets (one set with vertices A-E and another set with vertices 1-5), with edges only connecting vertices between these two sets and no edges connecting vertices within the same set. The graph has multiple edge crossings but maintains the fundamental bipartite property of having connections only between the two separate vertex groups."
