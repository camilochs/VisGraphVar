   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices can be divided into two distinct sets (one set on the left and one set on the right) such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. There are no edges within the same set, which is a characteristic of bipartite graphs. The graph also appears to be complete within each layer, as each vertex on the left is connected to every vertex on the right and vice versa."
