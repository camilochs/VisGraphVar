   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices are organized into two distinct sets, with edges only connecting vertices from different sets. There are no cycles within each set, and the graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings, which is typical for bipartite graphs of this size."
