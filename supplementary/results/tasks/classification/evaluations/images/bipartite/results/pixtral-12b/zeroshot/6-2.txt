Based on the graph visualization provided in the image, here is the classification:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex."
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Complete Graph**: This graph is classified as a complete graph because each of the first five nodes (A, B, C, D, E) is connected to each of the five right nodes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). In its entirety, all vertices have edges connecting them to every other vertex. This strigent structure of interconnections is characteristic of a complete graph.
