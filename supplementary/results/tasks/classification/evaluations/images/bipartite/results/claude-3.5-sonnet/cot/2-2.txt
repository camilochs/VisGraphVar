   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices are clearly divided into two distinct sets (letters A-E on the left and numbers 1-5 on the right), with edges only connecting vertices between these two sets and never within the same set. The graph cannot be classified as other types since it contains edge crossings (not planar), has no cycles (not cyclic), is not fully connected (not complete), and does not have a clear hierarchical structure (not a tree)."
