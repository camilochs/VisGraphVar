   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices can be clearly divided into two distinct sets (left and right), and every edge connects a vertex from one set to a vertex in the other set. There are no edges connecting vertices within the same set. The presence of multiple edges between the sets indicates that it is not complete. Additionally, the graph contains cycles, which rule out the possibility of it being a tree."
