Let's analyze the provided graph step-by-step.

1. **Cycles:**
   - There are multiple paths from vertices on the left to vertices on the right that begin and end at the same vertex, indicating the presence of cycles. For example, from vertex A, cycles such as A-1-3-A or A-1-4-A are apparent.

2. **Connectivity Pattern:**
   - The graph is fully connected between the two sets: each vertex on the left (A, B, C, D, E) connects to each vertex on the right (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
   - Vertices are not organized in strictly hierarchical or isolated sets.

3. **Edge Crossings:**
   - There are several edge crossings. For example, the edge between D and 4 crosses the edge between A and 4.
   - The graph can't be drawn without edge crossings, suggesting it is not a planar graph.

### Final Classification and Analysis:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains several cycles, indicating paths that start and end at the same vertex, such as from A to 1 to 3 to A. The vertices are fully interconnected between two sets, and edge crossings are present, ruling out a planar structure."
