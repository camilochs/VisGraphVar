**Step 1: Identify the properties of each graph type.**

*   **Acyclic**: A graph without any cycles is known as an acyclic graph.
*   **Bipartite**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects two vertices from different sets.
*   **Complete**: A complete graph is a graph with the maximum number of edges or all the nodes have edges to each other.
*   **Cyclic**: If there is a closed path present in the graph, then the graph is known as a cyclic graph.
*   **Mesh**: A mesh network is a local area network (LAN) topology where all the connected network devices are known by the devices and the topology is known by the devices. All the connected nodes are directly connected to other nodes via each node serving a different path.
*   **Planar**: A planar graph is a graph that can be embedded in the plane, i.e., it can be drawn on a flat surface in such a way that no two edges are intersecting.
*   **Tree**: A tree graph has no closed paths, it can be traversed in a single path.

**Step 2: Identify the graph properties based on the image.**

The graph contains multiple nodes and edges. There are no closed paths, so it's not cyclic. The graph can be drawn on a flat surface without any intersecting edges, making it planar. However, there are multiple paths between some nodes, which means it does not meet the criteria for a tree graph.

**Step 3: Conclusion**

Based on the properties identified in the image, the graph is classified as a mesh graph because all the connected nodes have edges to other nodes, and each node serves as a different path.

**Solution**

The final answer is:

{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph."
