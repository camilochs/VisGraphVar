   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices can be divided into two distinct sets (left side with letters A-E and right side with numbers 1-5), with edges only connecting vertices between these two sets and never within the same set. There are no cycles, and while edges cross each other, this is just due to the visualization layout rather than being inherent to the graph structure."
