To classify the graph shown in the image, we need to analyze its structure and properties. Based on the visual representation, the graph connects five nodes on the left to five corresponding nodes on the right with direct edges.

Here is the analysis of the graph:

1. **Acyclic**: There are no cycles in the graph. Each node on the left connects directly to the nodes on the right without forming any loops.
2. **Bipartite**: The nodes can be divided into two groups (left and right) such that no two nodes within the same group are adjacent. The edges only occur between the two groups.
3. **Complete**: Each node in one group is connected to every node in the other group. Hence, it forms a completeite graph.
4. **Cyclic**: Since there are no cycles, the graph is not cyclic.
5. **Mesh**: The graph does not form a mesh structure, which typically involves full connectivity within a grid-like structure.
6. **Planar**: The graph is planar because it can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing.
7. **Tree**: The graph is not a tree, as it does not have a hierarchical structure with no cycles and exactly one path between any two nodes.

Based on the above analysis, the graph is classified as **completeite**.
