   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices are organized into two distinct sets (left and right) such that all edges connect vertices from one set to the other, and no edges connect vertices within the same set. The graph does not form a complete or cyclic structure, and it is not planar due to the edge crossings."
