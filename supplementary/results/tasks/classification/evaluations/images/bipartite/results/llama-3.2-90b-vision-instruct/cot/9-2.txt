**Graph Analysis**

To determine the type of graph, we will analyze its characteristics step by step.

**Step 1: Checking for Cycles**

The graph contains at least one cycle, as evidenced by the path A-B-C-A. This indicates that the graph is not acyclic.

**Step 2: Examining Connectivity Pattern**

The graph does not have all vertices connected to each other. For example, vertex A is not directly connected to vertex E. Therefore, it is not a complete graph.

The graph does not exhibit a clear hierarchical structure, ruling out the possibility of it being a tree.

There are no distinct sets of vertices that are only connected within their respective subsets, indicating that the graph is not bipartite.

**Step 3: Analyzing Edge Crossings**

The graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings. Specifically, the edges E-B and C-2 cross each other.

The edges do not form a regular pattern or grid, which eliminates the possibility of the graph being a mesh.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph contains cycles and lacks a hierarchical structure or distinct sets of vertices. It also cannot be drawn without edge crossings and does not form a regular pattern.

**Classification and Analysis**

```json
{
  "type_graph": "cyclic",
  "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle (A-B-C-A) and cannot be drawn without edge crossings."
}
```

The graph is classified as cyclic due to the presence of cycles and the inability to draw it without edge crossings.
