According to the image:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete bipartite graph because it contains no cycles, the vertices are divided into two disjoint sets (the blue-labeled on the left and green-labeled on the right), and every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set with no additional connections within sets. The lack of edge crossings and the balanced connectivity further support this classification."
