  "type_graph": "bipartite",
  "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets (A, B, C, D, E and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) such that all edges connect a vertex from one set to a vertex in the other set. There are no edges within the same set. It is not a complete bipartite graph as not all possible connections between the two sets are present. Additionally, the graph is acyclic (no cycles), and planar (can be drawn without edge crossings)."
