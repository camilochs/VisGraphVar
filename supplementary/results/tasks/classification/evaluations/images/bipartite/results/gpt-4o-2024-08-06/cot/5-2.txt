   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices are organized into two distinct sets (A to E and 1 to 5) where every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. The graph contains no cycles, all edges go between the sets, and it does not form any hierarchical or grid-like pattern."
