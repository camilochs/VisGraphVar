Based on the image, the nodes and their node connections are as follows:

* A is connected to B, C, and E.
* B is connected to A and E.
* C is connected to A, D and E.
* D is connected to C and E.
* E is connected to A, B, C and D.
* There are three more orphan nodes called 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

By surveying the graph, one can notice that there is no connection between the top nodes and the numbers in the lower right hand corner. Therefore based on the positions of these orphan nodes, the category is planar. A planar graph is a graph in which each edge is a straight line segment, and any two edges do not touch except at an endpoint. A data structure consisting of open circles for each object, plus links connecting them if the data definition says that those two objects "are in group together" is called a geometric graph called a planar graph.
