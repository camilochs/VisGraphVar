**Graph Classification**

To classify the graph, we need to analyze its structure and properties.

The graph has multiple edges connecting different nodes. It does not have any self-loops or parallel edges. A graph is said to be **acyclic** if it contains no cycles, i.e., there is no path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A graph is **bipartite** if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects two vertices from different sets. A graph is considered **complete** if every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In contrast, a **cyclic** graph contains at least one cycle. A **mesh** describes the structure of a graph as a "wire grid" and is not typically used to classify graphs. A **planar** graph can be drawn in a plane in such a way that no two edges intersect except at their endpoints. Finally, a **tree** is an acyclic connected graph.

Based on the analysis of the graph provided, it can be observed that it contains cycles (for example, the cycle formed by nodes A, B, C, E, F). Therefore, it is not acyclic. It also does not meet the criteria for being bipartite because nodes cannot be divided into two sets where edges only connect nodes from different sets. The graph is not complete since not every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex. Given it contains cycles, the graph is indeed cyclic. The term "mesh" isn't standard in graph theory classification. The graph given can be drawn in a plane without any edge crossings, making it planar. Lastly, since the graph contains cycles, it cannot be classified as a tree.

Therefore, the classification of this graph is as follows:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic and planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic and planar graph."
}
