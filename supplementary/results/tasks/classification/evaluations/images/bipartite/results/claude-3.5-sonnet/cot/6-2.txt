   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices are clearly organized into two distinct sets (one set with vertices A-E in blue/grey, and another set with vertices 1-5 in green), with edges only connecting vertices between these two sets and no edges connecting vertices within the same set. The crossing edges and connection pattern confirm this is a bipartite structure, though not a complete bipartite graph as not every vertex from one set is connected to every vertex in the other set."
