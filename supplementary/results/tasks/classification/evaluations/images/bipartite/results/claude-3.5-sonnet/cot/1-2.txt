   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the vertices are organized into two distinct sets (one set with vertices A,B,C,D,E and another set with vertices 1,2,3,4,5), with edges only connecting vertices between these two sets and no edges connecting vertices within the same set. The graph contains multiple edge crossings but maintains the fundamental bipartite property where all connections are between the two distinct vertex groups."
