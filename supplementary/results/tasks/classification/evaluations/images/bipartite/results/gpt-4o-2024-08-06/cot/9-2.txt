   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because there are two distinct sets of vertices, and edges only connect vertices from one set to the other. There are no cycles within each set, and the vertices are not all connected to each other, which aligns with the properties of a bipartite graph. Additionally, the graph can be drawn without edge crossings by arranging the sets on opposite sides."
