I'll analyze the graph based on the given categories, and then provide a classification using the JSON format.

### Analysis:
1. **Acyclic**: An acyclic graph is one without cycles. In this graph, there are multiple paths from the left to the right side, indicating the existence of cycles.

2. **Bipartite**: Aite graph is one whose vertices can be divided into two sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. The graph given can be divided into two sets (left and right), so it isite.

3. **Complete**: A complete graph is one where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. This graph is not fully connected as all vertices on the left don't connect to all vertices on the right.

4. **Cyclic**: A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle. The graph has multiple paths from one side to the other, indicating cycles.

5. **Mesh**: A mesh (also known as a fully connected graph for the same number of vertices) is not applicable here because the connections do not form a grid pattern.

6. **Planar**: A planar graph can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. This graph does not fit into the plane without edges crossing, so it's not planar.

7. **Tree**: A tree is a connected acyclic graph. This graph is connected but has cycles.

### Classification:
Based on the analysis, the closest category for this graph is:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows aite graph."
}
```
