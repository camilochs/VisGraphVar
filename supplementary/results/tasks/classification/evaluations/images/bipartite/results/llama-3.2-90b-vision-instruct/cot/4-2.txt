**Image Analysis**

The image presents a graph exhibiting numerous edges connecting various vertices. Upon closer examination, we observe that this graph contains cycles, which are paths that both originate and terminate at the same vertex.

**Characteristics of the Graph**

* **Cycles**: The graph exhibits cycles, as evident in the paths connecting identical vertices.
* **Connectivity Pattern**: The graph does not display a hierarchical structure, nor are the vertices organized into distinct sets. Instead, all vertices are interconnected with one another.
* **Edge Crossings**: The graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings, and the edges do not form a regular pattern or grid.

**Classification**

Based on the analysis above, the graph is classified as a **complete graph**. A complete graph is characterized by the presence of **all possible edges** connecting vertices to one another. In other words, every pair of vertices within a complete graph are connected by an edge.

**Final Classification and Analysis in JSON Format**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every pair of vertices is connected by an edge."
}
```

Answer: **complete** graph.
