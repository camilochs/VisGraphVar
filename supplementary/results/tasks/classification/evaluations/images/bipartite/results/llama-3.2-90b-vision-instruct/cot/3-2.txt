**Classification Steps**

### Step 1: Cycle Detection

The graph exhibits multiple connections between vertices, including at least one cycle at the center. This characteristic is crucial in distinguishing cyclic graphs from acyclic and tree types.

### Step 2: Connectivity Pattern

*   **Global Connectivity**: The overall connectivity between vertices indicates that they are all interconnected either directly or indirectly through intermediate vertices. However, upon closer inspection, it's evident that not every vertex connects directly to every other vertex, which suggests it's not a complete graph.
*   **Organized Sets**: The graph does not display vertices organized into distinct sets that exclusively connect within themselves, eliminating the bipartite classification.
*   **Hierarchical Structure**: There is no clear hierarchical structure visible in the graph, which means we cannot classify it as a tree based on a hierarchical connectivity pattern.

### Step 3: Edge Crossings and Patterns

*   **Edge Crossings**: Due to the connections, edges intersect at several points. This characteristic indicates the graph is not planar since a planar graph can be drawn without any edge crossings.
*   **Regular Pattern or Grid**: The edges do not form a regular pattern or grid, which rules out the mesh graph classification.

### Conclusion

Based on the observations above, specifically the presence of cycles, interconnected vertices without a hierarchical structure, and edge crossings, this graph can be classified as follows:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains paths that start and end at the same vertex, with interconnected vertices that are not part of a hierarchical structure."
}
