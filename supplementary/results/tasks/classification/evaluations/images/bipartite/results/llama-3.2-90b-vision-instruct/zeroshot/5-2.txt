**Property to determine:** The type of graph in the given visualization.

**Relevant data:**

* The graph has 5 nodes (A, B, C, D, E) and 9 edges.
* There are no isolated nodes or edges.
* The graph does not contain any cycles (i.e., a path that starts and ends at the same node).
* Each edge connects exactly two distinct nodes.

**Analysis:**
A tree is an undirected graph that is connected and acyclic. In this case, the graph meets both conditions: it is connected (there is a path between every pair of nodes), and it does not contain any cycles. Therefore, the graph is a tree.

**Answer:**
```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph."
}
