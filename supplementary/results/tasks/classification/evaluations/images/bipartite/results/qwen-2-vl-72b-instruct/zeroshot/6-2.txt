To classify the graph visualization, let's analyze its structure:

1. **Vertices and Edges**: The graph has two sets of vertices, each set having five vertices. Each vertex in the left set is connected to one or more vertices in the right set.

2. **Connectivity**: The graph seems to be a type of network where vertices from one set are connected to the vertices of the other set. This type of graph is generally referred to as a **bipartite graph**.

3. **Cycles**: There are no self-loops or any indication of cycles within the same set of vertices. Each vertex connects to vertices in the other set.

4. **Planarity**: The graph appears to be planar as there are no obvious edge crossings in its current layout.

Since the graph has two distinct sets of vertices where each vertex from one set is connected to one or more vertices in the other set, and there are no cycles within the same set, the classification is:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph."
}
