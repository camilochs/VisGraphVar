**Step 1: Identify if the graph contains any cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex)**

In the graph, A has a direct edge to B, and B has a direct edge back to A, thus forming a single cycle. However, B also has a direct edge to A, forming a second cycle, while A has another direct edge back to B to form a third cycle.


**Step 2: Examine the connectivity pattern between vertices**

There are no two vertices in the image which each have a shared, direct edge to another. Therefore, the graph does not contain all connected vertices connected to all other vertices. However, we do see multiple distinct sets - A and B with the direct edges and E, D, and C along with one of the paths from A outwards.


**Step 3: Look at the edge crossings and analyze the graph structure**

There is a clear lack of a hierarchically-structured graph, because graph lacks multiple, distinct sets with an edge leading from one point to a different set of vertices.  In this image there are direct edges leading from A to E and B to D, so the graph does not have a hierarchal appearance of multiple connected, distinct sets which represent another type of image. The image does have edge crossings - so the graph does not appear to belong to be classified as planar. Instead, the graph contains multiple edges, paths and cycles (paths that end where they began). Looking at the structure of the image, notice there is a clear regular pattern, A direct edge to E, and a separate direct edge between D and C, as well as a direct edge from E to C and E to D. Therefore, the best classification is a mesh.


**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph visualization can be classified as a mesh graph because the image contains multiple edge crossings and multiple direct edges. The direct edge from A to B is combined with other direct edges. Combined, the cycles, paths and edges define a regular pattern seen most commonly in a mesh pattern.
