Let's analyze the graph according to the steps outlined:

1. **Check for cycles**:
   - By examining the graph, you can see that there are multiple paths that start and end at the same vertex, indicating the presence of cycles.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern**:
   - All vertices are directly connected to each other. This means it is a complete graph.
   - The vertices are not organized in distinct sets.
   - There is no hierarchical structure in the graph.

3. **Look at the edge crossings**:
   - The graph contains several edge crossings, indicating that it cannot be drawn in a plane without intersections.
   - The edges form a dense and interconnected pattern.

**Final Classification and Analysis**:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because all vertices are directly connected to every other vertex in the graph, which is a key characteristic of complete graphs. Additionally, the presence of multiple cycles and the density of the connectivity indicate that the graph is not planar."
