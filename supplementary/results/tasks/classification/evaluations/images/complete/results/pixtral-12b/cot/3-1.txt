Let's analyze the graph step-by-step to identify its type:

1. **Check for cycles:**
   - The graph contains multiple connections forming numerous cycles. Cycles are evident as the vertices are interconnecting in a non-linear manner, implying the graph is not acyclic.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern:**
   - All vertices are connected to each other in this graph, which indicates a complete connectivity.
   - The vertices are not organized into distinct sets, and there is no hierarchical structure.

3. **Edge crossings:**
   - The graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings, indicating it is not a planar graph (a graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing).

Based on these observations, the graph is completely connected, cyclic, and not planar.

The final classification is as follows:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because all vertices are connected to each other in a fully interconnected manner, and the graph is not planar due to the presence of multiple edge crossings."
}
```
