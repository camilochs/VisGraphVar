The graph visualization in the image depicts a fully connected graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Based on this observation, the classification of the graph can be made.

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph."
}
```

Explanation:
- **Complete Graph:** A graph is complete if every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In this graph, each vertex is connected to every other vertex, which is the defining characteristic of a complete graph.
