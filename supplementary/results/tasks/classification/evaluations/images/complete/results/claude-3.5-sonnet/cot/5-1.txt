   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex in the graph. There are 10 vertices (labeled 0-9), and each vertex has an edge connecting it to all other vertices, forming a fully connected network where no vertex is left unconnected to any other. This creates a dense network of intersecting edges where every possible connection between vertices exists."
