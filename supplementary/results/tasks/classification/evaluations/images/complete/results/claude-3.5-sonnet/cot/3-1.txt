   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex in the graph by exactly one edge. There are 10 vertices (numbered 0-9), and each vertex has edges connecting it to all 9 other vertices, forming a fully connected network with the maximum possible number of edges. This creates the characteristic dense, web-like appearance of a complete graph where no additional edges could be added between any vertices."
