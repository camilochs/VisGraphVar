  "type_graph": "cyclic",
  "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles. For example, 0-1-2-0, and 3-4-5-3. It is not complete since not all vertices are connected to each other (e.g., 0 is not directly connected to 3). It's also not bipartite as it contains odd length cycles. It's not a tree or acyclic because it has cycles. It's also not planar as it cannot be drawn without edge crossings (evident in the image). It's not a mesh in the typical meaning of having a regular grid-like structure."
