   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex in the graph by exactly one edge. This creates a maximally connected structure where all possible edges between vertices are present. The graph has 10 vertices (labeled 0-9) and each vertex has degree 9, connecting it to all other vertices, forming a K10 complete graph. While there are many edge crossings due to the complete connectivity, this is an inherent characteristic of complete graphs when drawn in 2D with more than 4 vertices."
