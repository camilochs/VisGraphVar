To analyze the graph visualization, let's proceed through each of the steps outlined:

1. **Check for cycles**: 
    - Observing the graph, there are multiple paths that start and end at the same vertex, indicating the presence of cycles.

2. **Examine connectivity patterns**:
    - **All vertices connected to all others**: The graph shows every vertex connected to every other vertex, forming a fully connected subgraph (clique) for each subset of vertices.
    - **Distinct sets**:Vertices aren't distinctly organized into non-intersecting sets.
    - **Hier structure**: The graph structure doesn't imply a clear hierarchical organization.

3. **Edge crossings**:
    - The numerous edges cross each other at various points, indicating the graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings.
    - There isn't a regular pattern or grid-like formation in the edge arrangement.

Based on these observations, the graph is a **complete graph**.

**Final classification and analysis**:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because all vertices are connected to each other, and the presence of cycles indicates that it is not acyclic orite. The numerous edge crossings exclude it from being planar, and the lack of a hierarchical or distinct set organization eliminates it from being a tree orite graph."
}
