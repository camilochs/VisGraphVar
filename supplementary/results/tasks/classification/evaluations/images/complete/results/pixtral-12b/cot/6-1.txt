1. **Cycle Check**:
   - The graph contains multiple cycles. For example, the path involving vertices \(0 \to 1 \to 6 \to 0\) forms a cycle.

2. **Connectivity Pattern**:
   - The graph is not acyclic since multiple cycles exist.
   - It is not a complete graph because not all possible edges are present.
   - The vertices do not form a strict bipartite structure as many vertices are interconnected in multiple paths.
   - There is no hierarchical structure as the connections are fairly balanced among all vertices.

3. **Edge Crossings**:
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, indicating it could be represented as a planar graph.

**Final Classification and Analysis**:

```json
{
    "type_graph": "planar",
    "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn in the plane with no edge crossings, and although it has cycles and is not completely connected, its structure is balanced enough to be represented in a planar form."
}
