To classify the given graph, let's analyze its characteristics:

1. **Acyclic**: The graph has cycles, so it is not acyclic.
2. **Bipartite**: The graph has edges connecting all vertices in such a way that it does not naturally split into two disjoint sets where no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. Therefore, it is not bipartite.
3. **Complete**: Each vertex is connected to every other vertex. This graph does not have an edge between every pair of vertices, so it is not complete.
4. **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles, so it is cyclic.
5. **Mesh**: A mesh usually refers to a graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex within a certain range (like a grid), which is not the case here.
6. **Planar**: The graph can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing, though it may not be simple.
7. **Tree**: A tree is acyclic and connected. This graph is cyclic, so it is not a tree.

Considering the given characteristics, the graph is best classified as "cyclic."
