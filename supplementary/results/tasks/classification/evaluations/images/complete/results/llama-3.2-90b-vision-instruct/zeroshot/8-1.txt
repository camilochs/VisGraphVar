Please provide the image for analysis.

**Step 1: Identify the type of Graph**

To accurately classify the graph, we need to determine its characteristics, such as connectedness, cycles, and vertex relationships.

**Step 2: Determine the required parameters**

*   Acyclic: No cycles are present in the graph.
*   Bipartite: The graph can be divided into two disjoint sets of vertices with no edges between them.
*   Complete: Every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
*   Cyclic: A cycle is present in the graph, i.e., a path that forms a circle.
*   Mesh: All vertices are connected directly.
*   Planar: The graph can be drawn on a flat surface without overlapping edges.
*   Tree: An undirected, connected graph with no cycles.

**Step 3: Analyze the provided image**

Without access to the image, we cannot provide a definitive answer. Please provide the requested image for analysis.

**Conclusion**

Once the image is submitted, we can perform the requested analysis and provide the answer based on a parameter, one of the seven:
