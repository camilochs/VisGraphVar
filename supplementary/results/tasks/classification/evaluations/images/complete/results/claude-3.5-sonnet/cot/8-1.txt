   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex in the graph, forming a fully connected network where each node has edges to all other nodes. This creates a dense network of intersecting edges with maximum connectivity between all vertices labeled 0-9."
