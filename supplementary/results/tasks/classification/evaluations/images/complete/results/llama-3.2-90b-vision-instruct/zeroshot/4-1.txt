In graph theory, graphs can be classified into different types based on specific characteristics. Let's analyze the provided image:

Given the graph, we can observe the following characteristics:

If any two distinct vertices of a graph are connected by a direct edge, then the graph is called a complete graph, where every connection between any set of vertices has been established.
In the image, you may note how every vertex is fully connected with every other vertex. 

So the answer will be as follows:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph."
}
```
