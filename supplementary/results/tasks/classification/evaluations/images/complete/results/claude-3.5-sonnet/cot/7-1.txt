   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex with exactly one edge. There are 10 vertices (labeled 0-9), and each vertex has edges connecting it to all 9 other vertices, forming a fully connected network with no missing connections. This results in the maximum possible number of edges for a simple graph with 10 vertices."
