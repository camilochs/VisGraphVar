  "type_graph": "cyclic",
  "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles. For example, 0-1-3-7-0 is a cycle. It's not a complete graph since not every vertex is connected to every other vertex, it's not bipartite or a tree as it contains cycles. It is also not planar because it cannot be redrawn without edge crossings (K5 is a subgraph with vertices 0, 1, 3, 6, 7 for instance). Finally, although it resembles some characteristics of a mesh graph with multiple interconnected paths, it's not strictly defined nor regular like a typical mesh.  The best classification based on the clearly observable properties is 'cyclic'."
