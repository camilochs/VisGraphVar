Based on visual analysis and the provided guidelines, the following conclusions can be drawn about the graph:

• One characteristic is obvious from the graph: it is a **complete graph**, signified by every possible edge represented and every node connected to every other node.
• Further observation leads to the conclusion that it is also **bipartite**, as represented by the two distinct groups or sets of vertices (in this example represented by dark edges on the right side and white edges on the left side of the graph).
• Another characteristic represented is the face, defined by the border of today's only seen by the edges going around the graph, but a closed ended path which does not use the same edge more than once.

The final classification: **bipartite graph**.

```json
{
   "type_graph": "Bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because the graph is split into two distinct groups or sets of vertices, represented by the different colored edge styles."
} 
```

A bipartite graph may be visualized in such a way to give clarity but typically would not be represented with overlapping node sets as seen in this image. It instead would be represented with the dark and white nodes on opposite sides of the graph, creating two sets of vertices represented by the dark and white nodes.
