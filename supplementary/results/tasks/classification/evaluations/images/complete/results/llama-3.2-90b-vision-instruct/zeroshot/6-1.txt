**Classification of the Graph Visualization**

This graph diagram represents a bipartite graph. 

A bipartite graph, also known as a bigraph, is a graph where every vertex belongs to one of two disjoint sets U and V. The edges connect vertexes across sets U and V only, and not with vertex from the same set. 

Note that even bipartite graph can not contain odd cycles, bipartite graph may sometimes be complete so this, by definition, will not necessarily be acyclic. Also, a regular bipartite graph will have same degree on all node, although this will require every node to have even degree and consequently a full bipartite graph will have same number of vertices in each set U and V.
