To classify the graph in the image, we'll follow the steps outlined and analyze each characteristic:

1. **Check for Cycles**: The graph contains many edges connecting various vertices, and upon closer inspection, we notice that the paths between vertices form loops. This indicates the presence of cycles.

2. **Examine Connectivity Pattern**: Not all vertices are connected to every other vertex, but a substantial number of vertices are interconnected. The vertices are not organized in distinct, separate sets; instead, they show a high level of interference across the graph.

3. **Look at Edge Crossings**: There are multiple edge crossings, indicating that the graph cannot be drawn without any crossings. This observation rules out it being a planar graph.

### Analysis

Based on the observations:
- **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles.
- **Planar**: The graph cannot be drawn without crossing edges.
- **Complete**: While not every vertex connects to every other vertex, there is extensive connectivity.

Given these characteristics, the most suitable classification for the graph is **mesh**.

### Final Classification

```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it contains cycles, lacks a hierarchical structure, and exhibits high connectivity where multiple edges cross."
}
