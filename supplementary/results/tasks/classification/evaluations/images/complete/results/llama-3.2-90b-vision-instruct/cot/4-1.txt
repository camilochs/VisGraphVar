**Step 1: Checking for cycles**
The graph contains loops that start and end at the same vertices, indicating the presence of cycles.

**Step 2: Examining connectivity patterns**
- All vertices are not connected to all other vertices.
- The graph doesn't display a clear bipartition with distinct sets of vertices.
- It doesn't form a hierarchical structure with a specific tree-like organization.

**Step 3: Analyzing edge crossings and patterns**

*   The graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings.
*   The edges form a network but do not display a regular pattern or grid resembling a mesh.

**Conclusion**
Based on these observations, the graph matches the characteristics of a complete graph, where every node is connected to every other node, and its cyclic nature due to the presence of paths that start and end at the same vertex. However, it doesn't fit perfectly into the given categories as it represents a complete cyclic graph, which isn't explicitly listed among the options. But considering the closest match and the nature of such graphs typically having cycles and connections akin to those described, the best approximation would be:

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because it connects all vertices to each other, but also contains cycles among the connections, which is not a characteristic of a purely complete graph but fits the closest given the provided categories."
}
