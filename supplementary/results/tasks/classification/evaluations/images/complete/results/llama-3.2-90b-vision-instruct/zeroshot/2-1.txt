To determine the properties of this graph, we can identify the following characteristics:

* A "complete graph" is a graph in which every possible edge is present.
* A "planar graph" is a graph that does not have any edge crossings.

The graph contains a web of nodes linked by lines, with 10 nodes, 35 edges, and every node directly linked to every other node. This meets the second property above.

The graph also depicts multiple nodes interconnected within a circular blank space. However, if the vertices are rearranged so that none of the edges overlap in this visualization, the nodes are interconnected in a circular structure, thus meeting the criteria to be considered a "planar graph."

Additionally, "planar graphs" cannot be cyclic, bipartite, mesh, or tree graphs. However, they can be twofold, i.e. complete and planar.

The graph meets the specific properties to be considered for the complete planar label: "complete planar graph."

To answer the question, we can construct this graph classification in JSON format like this:

```json
{
    "type_graph": "complete_planar",
    "analysis": "The image shows a complete planar graph."
}
```
