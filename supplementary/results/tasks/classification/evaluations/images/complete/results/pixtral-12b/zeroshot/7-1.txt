To analyze and classify the graph in the image, we need to examine its properties.

1. **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles.
2. **Bipartite**: The graph cannot be colored with two colors, indicating it is not bipartite.
3. **Complete**: All vertices are connected to each other.
4. **Planar**: The method of drawing makes it non-planar.
5. **Mesh**: Not all points are connected in such a way indicating a true mesh topology.
6. **Tree**: The graph is not acyclic and has multiple connections.

Based on the analysis:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph."
}
```
