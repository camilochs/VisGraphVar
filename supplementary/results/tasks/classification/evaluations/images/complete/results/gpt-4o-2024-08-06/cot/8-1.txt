   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because all vertices are connected to all other vertices, forming a highly interconnected network with no hierarchical structure or distinct sets. This graph contains cycles and cannot be drawn without edge crossings, indicating a non-planar structure, typical of complete graphs."
