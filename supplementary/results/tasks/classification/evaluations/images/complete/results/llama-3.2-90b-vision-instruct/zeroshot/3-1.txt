**Determining Graph Type**

### Step 1: Overview

This graph is a collection of interconnected vertices and edges, already excluding the possibility of being acyclic, bipartite, complete, or mesh graphs.

### Step 2: Classification Determination

The graph contains multiple cycles (sets of interconnected vertices that form loops). A key characteristic of a cyclic graph, eliminating the possibility of it being a tree.

However, the graph is not planar. This is due to its inability to be drawn in a two-dimensional plane without intersecting edges. Such intersections are observed at least once when attempting to plot the graph on a 2D surface.

### Conclusion

Based on these observations, the graph can be classified as cyclic. Its properties, particularly containing cycles and failing to meet planarity requirements, align with the characteristics of a cyclic graph.
