   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex with an edge. There are 10 vertices (numbered 0-9) and each vertex has edges connecting it to all other vertices, forming a maximally connected structure. The high number of edge crossings is characteristic of complete graphs when drawn in 2D, as it's impossible to draw a complete graph with more than 4 vertices in a planar way without edge crossings."
