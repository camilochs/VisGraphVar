   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph with multiple interconnected vertices (labeled 0-9) forming numerous cycles. Each vertex is connected to multiple other vertices through edges, creating multiple closed loops or cycles within the graph structure. The dense interconnections and presence of multiple cycles clearly categorize this as a cyclic graph."
