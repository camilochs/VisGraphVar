   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because all vertices are connected to all other vertices. There are no cycles of length less than 3, and the connectivity pattern is such that every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. Additionally, there are no edge crossings, indicating that the graph can be drawn in a planar manner. However, the primary characteristic that defines this graph as complete is the fact that every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex."
