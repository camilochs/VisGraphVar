To classify the graph, we examine its characteristics according to the steps outlined:

1. Checking for cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex):

   Upon examination of the graph, we notice there are edges connecting vertices in a way that forms closed loops. Several paths start at a vertex and end at the same vertex, indicating the presence of cycles within the graph. This confirms the graph is cyclic.

2. Investigating the connectivity pattern between vertices:

   We can see all vertices are connected, but they are not each connected to every other vertex. There isn't a clear bipartite characteristic of the graph.
   There is no hierarchical structure akin to a tree where connections are rooted from a point but connected in a manner they branch out hierarchically or laterally.
   There doesn't seem to be a predefined, side-by-side, grid-like mesh structure.

3. Considering edge crossings:

   In the context provided, we are first identifying if it can be categorized without considering physical rendering of the graph, i.e., crossings are not applicable in theoretical categorization without a drawing request.
   However, by default, we can tell this graph is not part of a known grid by spacing, so even if it wasn't explicitly requested to draw it in that manner it is not planar.

4. Synthesizing information

   Given the graph's cyclic nature, the absence of bipartite, complete, or tree-like structures, and the lack of an inherent mesh pattern, we can narrow down its type.


Conclusion:

```json
{
    "type_graph": "cyclic",
    "analysis": "The graph is classified as cyclic due to the existence of cycles and the connectivity pattern is non-underlying for classifications such as mesh or planar considering the description."
}
