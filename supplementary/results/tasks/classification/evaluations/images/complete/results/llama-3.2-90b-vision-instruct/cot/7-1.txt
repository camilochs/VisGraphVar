Based on the image, it appears to be a complete graph.

The image depicts a graph with 10 vertices (labeled 0 through 9) and all possible edges between them. This means that every vertex is connected to every other vertex, which is the defining characteristic of a complete graph. Therefore, the correct classification for this graph is:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every vertex is connected to every other vertex."
}
```
