  "type_graph": "cyclic",
  "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles. For example, 0-1-2-3-0 forms a cycle. It's not a complete graph since not every vertex is connected to every other vertex.  It's also not bipartite (vertices cannot be divided into two sets where edges only connect between sets). It's not a tree or acyclic since it has cycles. It's not a mesh in the strict sense, where edges connect each vertex in a grid-like fashion. While the graph might appear complex, careful redrawing can eliminate edge crossings, indicating it's planar."
