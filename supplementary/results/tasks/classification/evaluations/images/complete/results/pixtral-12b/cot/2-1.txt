Let's analyze the graph visualization using the steps described:

1. **Check for Cycles:**
   - By examining the graph carefully, we can see multiple paths that start and end at the same vertex, indicating that there are cycles in the graph. This means the graph is not acyclic.

2. **Examine Connectivity Pattern:**
   - Every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the graph. This is evident from the dense interconnection of the vertices.
   - The vertices do not form distinct sets or hierarchical structures.
   - This connectivity pattern suggests a complete graph.

3. **Look at Edge Crossings:**
   - The graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings due to the high interconnectivity.
   - The edges form a dense, interwoven pattern, which typically suggests a graph that is not planar.

Based on these observations, the graph is best classified as a **complete graph**.

### Final Classification and Analysis:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because all vertices are connected to every other vertex, indicating a high level of interconnectivity which is characteristic of a complete graph. Additionally, the presence of numerous cycles and the inability to draw the graph without edge crossings supports this classification."
}
