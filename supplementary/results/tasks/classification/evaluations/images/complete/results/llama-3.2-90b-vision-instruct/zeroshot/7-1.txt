**Graph Classification Request**

The provided request involves analyzing a graph and categorizing it into one of the following types:

*   Acyclic
*   Bipartite
*   Complete
*   Cyclic
*   Mesh
*   Planar
*   Tree

However, the request lacks a visual representation of the graph. Typically, a graph image or schema would be expected for accurate classification. 

In the absence of a graph image, I will make an educated guess for the sake of providing an example response. Let's assume the graph in question exhibits characteristics consistent with definitions:

**Response Guess**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph."
}
```

Keep in mind that this classification is speculative without an actual graph for reference.
