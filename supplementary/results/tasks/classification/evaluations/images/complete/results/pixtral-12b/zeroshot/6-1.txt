To accurately classify the graph shown in the image, let's analyze its properties:

1. **Cyclic or Acyclic**: The graph contains cycles (e.g., most vertices are connected to each other in a repeating pattern), hence it is cyclic rather than acyclic.
2. **Bipartite**: Aite graph can be split into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. This graph cannot be split into two such disjoint sets, as vertices are highly interconnected, implying it is notite.
3. **Complete**: A complete graph has every vertex connected directly with every other vertex. This graph appears to have every vertex connected with every other vertex, making it a complete graph.
4. **Planar**: A planar graph can be drawn on a plane without edges crossing. This graph is complex and cannot avoid edge crossings, so it is not planar.
5. **Mesh**: A mesh graph has vertices connected in a grid-like pattern. This graph does not have a grid structure, eliminating it from the mesh category.
6. **Tree**: A tree graph is acyclic and connected, meaning it has no cycles and forms a single path. This graph has cycles, thus it is not a tree.

Given the analysis, the graph can be classified as:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph."
}
```
