  "type_graph": "cyclic",
  "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles. For instance, the path 0-1-6-0 constitutes a cycle. It's not bipartite since there's no distinct set division. It is not complete because not every vertex is connected to every other vertex.  It's not a tree or acyclic because of the presence of cycles. The graph isn't planar because it cannot be drawn without edge crossings. Finally, it is clearly not a mesh graph due to its complex connectivity pattern with no regular grid or matrix-like connectivity."
