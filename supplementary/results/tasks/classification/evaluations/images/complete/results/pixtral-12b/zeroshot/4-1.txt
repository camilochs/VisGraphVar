To classify the graph in the image, we must examine its properties and Characteristics.

After analyzing the graph, here is the classification:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph. Every vertex is connected to every other vertex with an edge."
}
```

Explanation:
- A complete graph is one in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
- In the provided image, each of the 10 vertices (labeled 0 through 9) has an edge connecting it to every other vertex.
- This satisfies the property of a complete graph where all vertices are fully connected.
