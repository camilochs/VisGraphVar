}
```

### Analysis:
- **Vertices**: The graph has 10 vertices, labeled from 0 to 9.
- **Edges**: Every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
- **Properties**: A complete graph is one in which every pair of vertices is connected by a unique edge. This graph satisfies this property.
- **Class的に**: Based on the connections, the graph is classified as a complete graph (K10), indicating that all vertices are interconnected.

The image depicts a complete graph.
