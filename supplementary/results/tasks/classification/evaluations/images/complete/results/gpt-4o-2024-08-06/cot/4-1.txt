   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because all vertices are connected to all other vertices. There are cycles present since every vertex can form a cycle with any other two vertices. The connectivity pattern demonstrates that each vertex has an edge to every other vertex, indicating a complete graph structure."
