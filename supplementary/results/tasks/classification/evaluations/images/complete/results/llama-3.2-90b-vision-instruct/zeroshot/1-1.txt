Based on the provided diagram, we can identify the connections between the nodes. The graph is fully connected, but we can verify the different properties one by one:

*   Acyclic: The graph is not acyclic because it contains a cycle, typically consisting of multiple edges interconnected between the nodes.
*   Bipartite: The graph is not bipartite because it does not consist of two disjoint sets, represented by two shapes, which restricts edge connections to only be between the two sets.
*   Complete: Non-dense graphs do not meet the condition for being complete, as shown in the diagram. A fully connected graph is necessary.
*   Cyclic: This graph does contain cycles. For example: 3-1-6-0

    ```
`
      3--1--6--0--3
      --8----/
```
    As mentioned, each node in the graph is connected to every other node, so it can also be concluded that the graph contains smaller cycles cutting across the graph. However, simply showing a vertex-to-vertex connection by skipping across does not necessarily make a graph cyclic; in this case though, the directed paths lead directly back to one of the starting vertices, such as V1 from the V0 given here.
*   Mesh: Mesh graphs are toroidal graphs (can be drawn cross occurs on a torus or doughnut-shaped surface without any actual crossing or overlapping of the various edges), which this graph is not.
*   Planar: The graph does not have intersections between edges (no self-loops and no allowed crosses as well). The edges of a planar graph may be divided into two non-empty sets. Such division may cause the supplementation of nodes if the edges on the inner edge-plane tend to be few.
*   Tree: The graph possesses cycles (closed loops), and as a result, cannot be classified as a tree. A tree diagram is important as a hierarchical representation in an organized fashion starting from its parent node "root" or origin. A tree with "n" nodes has exactly "n-1" edges.

Since a complete graph is an undirected graph where there is an edge connecting every pair of distinct vertices, then it contains every possible edge. Therefore, this diagram can be classified as a complete graph.
