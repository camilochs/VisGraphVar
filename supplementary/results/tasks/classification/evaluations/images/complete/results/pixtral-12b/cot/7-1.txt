To analyze the graph in the visualization, let's go through the steps one by one.

1. **Check for cycles:**
   - The graph contains multiple edges that connect vertices in loops, indicating the presence of cycles.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern:**
   - Each vertex in the graph is connected to every other vertex. This means the graph is fully connected (each vertex has edges with all other vertices).
   - The vertices are not organized in distinct sets or forming a hierarchical structure.

3. **Look at edge crossings:**
   - The graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings due to the high number of lines.

Based on these observations, the graph closely matches the properties of a complete graph.

Here is the final classification and analysis in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because all vertices are interconnected, forming cycles and having no hierarchical structure, with numerous edge crossings and no distinct sets of vertices."
}
```
