   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex in the graph. This can be seen by the extensive network of edges where each numbered node (0-9) has a direct edge connecting it to all other nodes, forming a fully connected structure where no additional edges could be added to increase connectivity. The graph also contains multiple cycles and cannot be drawn in a planar way due to the numerous edge crossings."
