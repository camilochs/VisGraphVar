Let's analyze the graph step by step.

1. **Checking for cycles:**
   - The graph contains vertices labeled from 0 to 9 and multiple edges connecting various vertices. 
   - For instance, vertices 0, 2, and 4 form a cycle via edges: 0-2-4.
   - Thus, it contains cycles.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern:**
   - The graph is not complete since not all vertices are connected to all other vertices directly.
   - It is not organized in a distinct bipartite manner (two sets of vertices where no two vertices within the same set are connected).
   - The connectivity does not form a hierarchical structure specific to a tree.

3. **Edge crossings:**
   - The graph exhibits several edge crossings.
   - It cannot be drawn without any edge crossings, which eliminates the graph from being planar.

Based on these observations, the graph is best classified as a **cyclic graph**.

{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles (e.g., the path 0-2-4), the vertices are not completely or hierarchically connected, and there are edge crossings, making it non-planar."
}
