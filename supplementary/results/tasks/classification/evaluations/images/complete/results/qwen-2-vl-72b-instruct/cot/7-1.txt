   "type_graph": "complete",
   "analysis": "The image shows a complete graph because every vertex is connected to every other vertex with no repeated edges or loops. There are no cycles, no distinct sets of vertices, and no hierarchical structure. The graph cannot be drawn planar as there are edge crossings, but this is expected in a complete graph."
