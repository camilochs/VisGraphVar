Let's analyze the graph based on the given steps:

1. **Check for cycles**: 
   - The graph is laid out in a grid pattern, and it is visually evident that there are clear loops (cycles) within the rows and columns. Specifically, each vertex has edges forming a rectangular loop, indicating the presence of cycles.

2. **Examine connectivity patterns**:
   - Every vertex is connected to exactly four other vertices (up, down, left, right).
   - Vertices are not organized in distinct sets, and there is no hierarchical structure.
   - This connectivity pattern looks uniform and regular.

3. **Edge crossings**:
   - The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings in a grid layout.
   - The edges form a regular pattern, indicating a structured mesh-like grid.

Based on these characteristics, the graph can be classified as a **mesh** or **grid**.

Here is the JSON classification:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it is structured in a uniform grid pattern with every vertex connected to exactly four other vertices, exhibiting cycles, and forming a regular pattern without edge crossings."
}
