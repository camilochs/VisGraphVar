Sure, let's analyze the graph:

1. **Acyclic**: The graph contains cycles, so it is not acyclic.
2. **Bipartite**: The graph can be divided into two sets such that every edge connects a node from one set to a node from the other set. Therefore, it is bipartite.
3. **Complete**: The graph does not have an edge between every pair of nodes. Hence, it is not a complete graph.
4. **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles, specifically rectangular cycles among the interconnected nodes, so it is cyclic.
5. **Mesh**: The graph has a grid-like structure where nodes are connected to all nearby nodes in a rectangular grid, so it is a mesh.
6. **Planar**: While the graph can be drawn without edges crossing, the number of edges closely approaches the maximum number of edges planar graphs can have, violating the rule for planarity. Therefore, it is not planar.
7. **Tree**: The graph has cycles and multiple nodes connected in a grid pattern, so it is not a tree.
