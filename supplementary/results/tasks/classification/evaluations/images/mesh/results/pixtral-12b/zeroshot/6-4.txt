The graph shown in the image is a grid or mesh structure. Based on the observed properties, here is the analysis:

{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph."
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Mesh Graph**: A mesh graph is a type of graph that represents a mesh, typically a rectangular grid structure such as the one shown in the image.
   - Each vertex is connected to every vertex adjacent to it in a grid formation.
   - This characteristic makes it distinct from other types of graphs such as trees, bipartite graphs, or planar graphs.

2. **Properties of Mesh Graphs**:
   - **Vertices and Edges**: The graph comprises of a certain number of vertices arranged in a grid format with edges connecting adjacent vertices both horizontally and vertically.
   - **Regularity**: Each vertex is connected to a fixed number of other vertices, specifically four in this case.
   - **Path Existence**: Between any pair of vertices, there exists a path due to the grid structure.

Given these properties, the graph fits the criteria of a mesh graph.
