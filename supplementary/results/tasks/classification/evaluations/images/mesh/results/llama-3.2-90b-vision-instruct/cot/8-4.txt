**Answer:**

The graph visualization can be classified as a cyclic mesh graph.

**Explanation:**

The steps used to determine the classification are as follows:

1.  **Cycles Detection:**
    *   The graph contains paths that start and end at the same vertex, therefore it is cyclic.
2.  **Connectivity Evaluation:**
    *   The graph does not have vertices connected to all other vertices, thus it is not complete.
    *   There is no evidence of vertices being organized into distinct sets, so it is neither bipartite nor acyclic.
    *   The graph lacks a hierarchical structure, indicating it is not a tree.
3.  **Edge Crossings Analysis:**
    *   The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, making it possible to classify it as planar.
    *   However, edges form a regular pattern or grid, which is characteristic of a mesh graph.
4.  **Classification:**
    *   Based on the observations, the graph best matches the characteristics of a cyclic mesh graph.

**Final Classification:**

```json
{
  "type_graph": "cyclic mesh",
  "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic mesh graph because it has cycles, doesn't have all vertices connected to all other vertices, can be drawn without edge crossings, and edges form a regular pattern or grid."
}
