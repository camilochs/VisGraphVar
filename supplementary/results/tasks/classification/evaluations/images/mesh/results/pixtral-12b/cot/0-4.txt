To analyze the graph and classify its type, we will follow the given steps:

1. **Cycle Check**: 

   By inspecting the graph, every vertex is connected in a grid pattern. Each row and each column forms a cycle (a closed loop). This suggests that the graph contains cycles.

2. **Connectivity Pattern**:

   - **All vertices to all**: Clearly, not every vertex is connected to every other vertex; connections are only between adjacent vertices in a grid pattern.
   - **Distinct sets**: There are no visible distinct sets of vertices that are entirely separate from each other.
   - **Hier structure**: The graph does not indicate a hierarchical arrangement.

3. **Edge Crossings**:

   - **Crossings**: Since the graph can be drawn in a grid without any edge crossings, it is a planar graph.
   - **Pattern**: The edges form a regular grid pattern typical of a mesh network.

Based on these observations, the graph can be classified as:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it contains cycles, vertices are connected in a regular grid pattern, and no edge crossings exist. This patterns is characteristic of a mesh network."
}
