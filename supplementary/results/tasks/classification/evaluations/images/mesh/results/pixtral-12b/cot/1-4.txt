Let's analyze the graph step-by-step to determine its type:

1. **Cycle Presence**: 

   The graph contains cycles (circular paths) that start and end at the same vertex. For instance, the path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,0) → (0,0) forms a cycle.

2. **Connectivity Pattern**:

   - The graph is not fully connected as not all vertices are connected to all others.
   - The vertices are organized in a grid pattern, forming a regular structure.
   - There is no hierarchical structure among the vertices.

3. **Edge Crossings**:

   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings.
   - The edges form a regular grid pattern.

Based on these observations, the graph appears to be a mesh graph due to its grid structure and regular pattern.

Here is the classification in JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it contains cycles, vertices are organized in a regular grid pattern, and edges form a regular structure without edge crossings."
}
```
