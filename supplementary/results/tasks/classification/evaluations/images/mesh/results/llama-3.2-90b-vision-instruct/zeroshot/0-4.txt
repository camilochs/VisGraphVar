**Step 1: Identify the graph type**

The image shows a graph with four rows and columns that form a rectangular lattice. 

**Step 2: Define the criteria for each graph type**

- **Acyclic graph**: A graph that does not have any cycles.
- **Bipartite graph**: A graph with vertices colored with two colors so that each edge connects a pair of vertices of different colors.
- **Complete graph**: A graph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
- **Cyclic graph**: A graph that has at least one cycle.
- **Mesh graph**: A graph that consists of multiple rectangular faces.
- **Planar graph**: A graph that can be embedded in the plane.
- **Tree graph**: A graph that is connected and acyclic.

**Step 3: Check each criteria**

- This graph has cycles, so it is not an **acyclic graph**.
- Vertices (edges upper right) appear as being connected to multiples nodes of the same color, so it is not a **bipartite graph**.
- Several pairs of vertices are not connected, so it is not a **complete graph**.
- The** mesh graph** classification fits the criteria.
- This graph can be embedded in the plane, so it pass the criteria for a **planar graph**.
- **Tree graphs** are acyclic, which this graph is not.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

Based on the steps followed, the image is of a *mesh graph* and can also belong to the planar graphs category. In the following JSON provided is the classification of the image:
