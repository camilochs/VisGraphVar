  "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it represents a grid-like structure. It's also planar because it can be drawn without any edge crossings.  It is cyclic as it contains multiple closed loops. It's bipartite because the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets (those with even row+column sum and those with odd row+column sum) such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set."
