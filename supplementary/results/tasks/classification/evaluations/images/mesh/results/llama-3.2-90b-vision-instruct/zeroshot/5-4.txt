**Step 1: Understand the graph**

The graph is a lattice network. It has 21 nodes numbered $(0,0)$ through $(4,4)$

**Step 2: Analyze connectedness**

Each node, except the farthest corner ones, is linked by edges with its 4 neighboring ones. These extreme nodes have 3 neighbors each.

**Step 3: Classify the graph**

The graph is planar: all of its nodes can be drawn into a 2-D plane without having any edges cross. The graph is also cyclic: there are multiple circuits through the nodes.

**Step 4: Determine the correct classification**

While the graph can be both planar and cyclic, the conventional single classification would default to it being a **graph mesh** due to its repetitve and periodic structure. This type of graph is also known as a lattice graph.

**Conclusion**

The graph is classified as a lattice or a mesh graph. adjacent nodes are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally positioned nodes.
