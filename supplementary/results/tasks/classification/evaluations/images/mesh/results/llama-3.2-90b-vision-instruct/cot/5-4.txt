The graph in the image is a planar, complete graph that is both cyclic and symmetric, with a recognizable grid pattern.

To classify this graph:

*   No cycles exist between vertices, as they are edge-connected and non-self-incident.
*   All vertices are interconnected, with no vertices grouped in distinct categories.
*   A tree pattern is not present because the graph contains an extensive pattern of connected edges between coordinates.
*   The planar nature of the graph means that edge crossings are nonexistent, allowing the graph to be visually and mathematically interpreted without any intersecting lines.

{
  "type_graph": "Planar, Complete, Cyclic, and Mesh",
  "analysis": "The image shows a Planar, Complete, Cyclic, and Mesh graph because all the vertices are directly or indirectly connected, which make cyclic or mesh pattern, no edge crossings exists, and(planar property), and finally all the vertices are directly connected."
