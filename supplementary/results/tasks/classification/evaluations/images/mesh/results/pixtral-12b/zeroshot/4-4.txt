The graph in the image is a grid-like structure where each vertex is connected to its adjacent vertices horizontally and vertically. Based on the structure and connectivity, here is the classification:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph."
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Mesh Graph**: This is a type of graph where each node is connected to every node in its row and column. This structure is characteristic of a grid or lattice, which matches the structure of the provided graph. In this grid network, each vertex (or node) is connected to its immediate neighbors in a regular pattern across both rows and columns, forming a grid-like mesh.
