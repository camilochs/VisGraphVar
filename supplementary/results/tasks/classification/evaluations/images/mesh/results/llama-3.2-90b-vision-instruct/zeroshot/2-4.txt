I'm sorry, but I don't see an image attached to the conversation. Without the image, I cannot analyze and classify the graph visualization. 

Please attach the image or provide its description so that I can assist you further. 

In general, I would analyze the graph based on its structure and properties, such as the number of nodes and edges, the presence of cycles, and the connectivity between nodes. 

Here is a sample response in JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph. It consists of two disjoint sets of vertices U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to a vertex in V."
} 
```

Please note that this is a hypothetical answer, and the actual classification would depend on the specific image provided.
