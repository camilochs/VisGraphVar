**Classification of the Graph**

To determine the type of graph represented in the image, we need to analyze its characteristics based on the given steps.

**Step 1: Cycles**
The graph contains paths that start and end at the same vertex, indicating the presence of cycles. This means it is not acyclic.

**Step 2: Connectivity Pattern**
The vertices are not organized into two distinct sets such that every edge connects a vertex from one set to a vertex in the other set, nor does every vertex connect to all other vertices. There isn't a hierarchical structure either; instead, there's a regular grid-like pattern where each node connects to its immediate neighbors horizontally, vertically, and diagonally in a consistent manner.

**Step 3: Edge Crossings**
The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, given its layout and nature. It indeed forms a regular pattern akin to a grid or mesh.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis:

* The graph is cyclic because it contains cycles.
* It is not bipartite or complete based on the connectivity pattern.
* It is not a tree since it contains cycles and doesn't exhibit a branching, hierarchical structure.
* It is planar as it can be drawn without edge crossings.
* Considering the regular and grid-like pattern of connectivity, along with the cyclic nature and planarity, the best classification for this graph is a mesh graph. Specifically, given its straightforward and undifferentiated connectivity across all directions (including diagonals), it aligns well with the characteristic of forming a grid or mesh where connections are not restricted to just horizontal and vertical lines but also include diagonal connections in a regular manner.

**Final Answer**

   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it forms a grid-like structure with each node connecting to its immediate neighbors in all directions (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally), contains cycles, and can be drawn without edge crossings."
