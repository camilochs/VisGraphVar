Based on the given grid-like structure in the image, the graph can be classified as a "mesh" or "grid" graph.

```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph."
}
```

Alternatively, it can be classified simply as a grid or a grid network, but "mesh" is a more technical term in graph theory.

```json
{
   "type_graph": "grid",
   "analysis": "The image shows a grid graph."
}
```

Both classifications apply because the structure forms a regular pattern where each node is connected to its adjacent nodes, typical of a mesh or grid topology.
