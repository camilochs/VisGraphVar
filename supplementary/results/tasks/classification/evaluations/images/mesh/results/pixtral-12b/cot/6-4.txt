Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. ** civilians containing any cycles:**
   - The graph appears to be a grid layout, ensuring each vertex is connected in four potential directions (up, down, left, right).
   - Starting from one vertex, you can follow a path back to the original vertex, meaning it contains cycles.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern:**
   - The vertices are organized in a distinct pattern with five columns and five rows.
   - Vertices are not completely connected to all other vertices; instead, there is a structured connectivity where each vertex connects to its immediate neighbors (left, right, up, down).

3. ** Edge crossings:**
   - The graph is structured as a grid, and it can be drawn without edge crossings.
   - Edges form a regular pattern typical of a grid.

Given these observations, the graph most closely matches the characteristics of a **mesh** type graph.
