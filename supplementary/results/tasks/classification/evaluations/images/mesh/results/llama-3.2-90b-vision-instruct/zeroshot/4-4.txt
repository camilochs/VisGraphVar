**Analysis of the Graph**

The graph presented is a representation of 16 nodes arranged in a 4x4 grid, where each node maintains one or more connections to adjacent nodes horizontally or vertically. 

**Classification**

Based on the arrangement of nodes, the horizontal and vertical connections devoid of diagonal connections, and a lack of self-loops, this graph is a **complete bipartite graph** with two sets of nodes not directly connected to each other but all nodes in one set are connected to all nodes in another set.
