**Analysis of the Graph**

To determine the type of graph, we will analyze its characteristics step by step.

**Step 1: Checking for Cycles**

The graph contains no cycles, as there are no paths that start and end at the same vertex.

**Step 2: Examining Connectivity**

*   The graph does not have all vertices connected to all other vertices.
*   Vertices are organized in distinct sets, with no hierarchical structure.

**Step 3: Looking at Edge Crossings**

*   The graph can be drawn without edge crossings.
*   Edges do not form a regular pattern or grid.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph is a **bipartite graph**. A bipartite graph is defined as a graph that has two sets of vertices (A and B), with all edges connecting one vertex from set A to a vertex in set B.

Given the information above, here is the json representation:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "bipartite",
   "analysis": "The image shows a bipartite graph because it has two sets of vertices with all edges connecting one vertex from set A to a vertex in set B."
}
