**Step 1: Identify the graph type**

**Analysis**

The graph visualization represents a directed graph that contains no edge which begins and ends at the same vertex (loop-less) and there exists an edge from every vertex to every other vertex. By these attributes alone, it is a Type of Complete Graph. However, a complete graph that represents a set of n vertices which are connected to each other such that exactly one of the two conditions holds:

*   If an edge is directed from vertex u to vertex v, then it **cannot** be directed from vertex v to vertex u.
*   And if u is connected to v and v connected to u i.e. there is one direction but not both

**Classification**

Therefore, the graph in the image is a Complete Graph.
