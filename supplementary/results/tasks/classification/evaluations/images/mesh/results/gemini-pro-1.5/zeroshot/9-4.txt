  "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it represents a regular grid-like structure. It is also planar because it can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings.  It is cyclic because it contains closed loops (cycles). It is bipartite because the nodes can be partitioned into two sets such that all edges connect nodes from different sets (e.g., nodes with even sum of coordinates and nodes with odd sum of coordinates)."
