The graph is a grid with nodes at lattice points. It has both horizontal and vertical connections between the nodes, resulting in four possible edges from each node.

*   The graph does not have any cycles because no edge starts and ends at the same vertex or traverses the same edge twice. Therefore, it is an acyclic graph.
*   The graph is bipartite since  each node has either two or four edges connected to it, and these nodes can be colored with two colors so that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. However, the graph also has a different color for every other lattice point along with the diagonal, making it a checkerboard-patterned bipartite graph.
*   We do not have a complete graph because it is missing many possible edges. For example, there are no edge connections between diagonally adjacent nodes, or direct horizontal connections from the bottom-most row of nodes to the top-most row of nodes.
*   As already established above, it is cyclic because it does not have cycles and is not complete because not all crystals are in direct connection.
*   All the grid papers used in mathematics allow the index at a lattice point to be uniquely determined with just the row  and column numbers of the lattice  point, and it is hard to imagine any grid other than those in the grid paper which allows this.  Therefore, it seems that it's a pretty safe bet that the graph is a mesh.
*   The graph appears to be planer since there are no unpleasant edge crossings or intersections. We can only imagine geometric impression but realistically if you want a nice 3-dimensional reproduction, or any surface graph, the connections between the different lattice points would all appear to come from different spatial dimensions. In effect, the graph is a mesh and planer.
*   Finally , the mesh is not a tree because it contains cycles

**Solution:**

*   Type_graph: planar mesh
*   Analysis: The image shows a planar mesh graph.

The  final answer is:

    "type_graph": "planar mesh",
