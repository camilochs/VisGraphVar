Let's analyze the graph step by step to determine its type.

1. **Check for Cycles:**
   - Following the vertices along the edges in any direction forms grid-like pathways that eventually lead back to their starting point. This indicates the presence of cycles.

2. **Examine Connectivity Pattern:**
   - The vertices are arranged in a grid pattern (5 rows and 5 columns).
   - All vertices are directly connected to adjacent vertices both horizontally and vertically.
   - The graph is not a hierarchical structure. All vertices are similarly connected in a systematic grid pattern.

3. **Consider Edge Crossings:**
   - The graph can be drawn in the plane without any edge crossings, indicating it is a planar graph.
   - The edges form a regular grid-like pattern.

Based on these observations, the graph can be classified as a mesh (grid) graph because it forms a regular rectangular grid pattern with vertices connected to adjacent vertices both horizontally and vertically.
