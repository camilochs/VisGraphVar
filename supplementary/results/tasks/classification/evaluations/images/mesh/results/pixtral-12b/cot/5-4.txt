To analyze the graph, let's go through each step:

1. **Checking for cycles:**
   - The graph contains vertices connected in a grid pattern. An inspection shows that you can traverse from one vertex to another in such a way that you eventually return to the starting vertex (e.g., moving diagonally or along edges). This indicates that there are cycles in the graph.

2. **Examine connectivity patterns:**
   - All vertices are connected in a regular and systematic way. Vertices are organized in rows and columns.
   - There is no distinct set organization or hierarchical pattern; instead, all vertices are interconnected forming a grid structure.

3. **Edge crossings:**
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, making it a planar graph.
   - The edges form a regular pattern, forming a grid or mesh layout.

**Final classification and brief analysis:**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it contains multiple cycles and has a regular and systematic interconnection of vertices forming a grid pattern without any edge crossings."
}
