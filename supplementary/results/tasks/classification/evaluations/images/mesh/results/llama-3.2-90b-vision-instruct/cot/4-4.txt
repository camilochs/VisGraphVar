**Classification Request**

A detailed image of the graph being analyzed is required to provide an accurate classification. Without the image, it is impossible to determine the graph's structure and category.

Here's a placeholder JSON response:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "[awaiting image]",
   "analysis": "Please provide the image for analysis and classification."
}
```
