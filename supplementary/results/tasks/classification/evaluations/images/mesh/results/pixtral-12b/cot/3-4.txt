To determine the type of the graph shown in the image, follow the steps outlined in the analysis:

1. **Check for Cycles**: The graph forms a grid structure, which inherently includes cycles. For example, you can find a cycle starting from any vertex, going horizontally or vertically, and returning to the starting vertex.

2. **Examine Connectivity Pattern**:
   - **Connectivity**: Every vertex is connected to its neighbors horizontally and vertically.
   - **Vertex Sets**: Vertices are not organized into distinct sets.
   - **Hier Structure**: The vertices are laid out in a grid, indicating a regular pattern.

3. **Edge Crossings**: 
   - **Crossings**: The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, as it sets out in a regular, non-overlapping pattern.
   - **Pattern**: The edges form a grid pattern indicating symmetry and regularity.

Given these observations, the graph's structure most closely aligns with the "mesh" type.

### Final Classification
```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it forms a grid structure with vertices connected to their neighbors horizontally and vertically, and can be drawn without edge crossings, aligning with the characteristic connectivity pattern of a mesh graph."
