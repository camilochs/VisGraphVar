  "type_graph": "mesh, planar, cyclic, bipartite",
  "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because the nodes are connected in a grid-like pattern. It is planar because it can be drawn without any edge crossings. It is cyclic as there are multiple closed paths (cycles) within the grid structure (e.g., (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1)). It is bipartite because the nodes can be divided into two disjoint sets (e.g., nodes with even sum of coordinates and nodes with odd sum of coordinates) such that every edge connects a node from one set to a node from the other set."
