Let's analyze the given graph visualization step-by-step to determine its type.

1. **Checking for cycles**: 
   - The graph contains cycles. Each row and each column form a cycle when moving from the first vertex to the last vertex and returning to the first vertex.

2. **Examining the connectivity pattern**:
   - The graph is clearly not acyclic since it has cycles.
   - Not all vertices are connected to all other vertices. Each vertex is connected only to its adjacent vertices horizontally and vertically, forming a grid-like structure.
   - The vertices are not directly connected without intermediate vertices when compared to a complete graph.
   - The organization appears to be in rows and columns, forming a grid-like pattern.

3. **Edge crossings**:
   - The edges can be drawn without crossings since the grid-like pattern avoids any crossings between edges naturally.
   - The pattern does look like a regular grid, which is characteristic of a mesh network.

Based on this analysis, the graph behaves like a mesh and a grid. 

Here is the classification in the required format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "mesh, grid",
   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh, grid graph because it contains cycles and is organized in a regular grid pattern without any edge crossings."
}
```
