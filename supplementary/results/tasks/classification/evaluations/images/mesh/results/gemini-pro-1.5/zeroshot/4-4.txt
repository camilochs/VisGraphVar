  "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it forms a rectangular grid.  It's also planar because it can be drawn without any edge crossings. It has cycles, so it is cyclic. And it's bipartite: the nodes can be colored with two colors so that no edge connects two vertices of the same color (e.g., checkerboard coloring)."
