**Graph Analysis**

**Step 1: Cycle Detection**

*   Upon inspection, it is apparent that the graph contains cycles.
*   For instance, the path (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (0,0) forms a cycle.

**Step 2: Connectivity Pattern**

*   The vertices are not directly connected to all other vertices.
*   The graph cannot be divided into separate sets.
*   There are no hierarchical structures present in the graph.

**Step 3: Edge Crossings**

*   The graph cannot be represented without any edge crossings.
*   The edges form a regular pattern resembling a grid.

**Final Classification and Analysis**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar mesh graph because the edges form a grid-like pattern and the graph, although not purely planar, maintains a grid-like structure, containing edges within the 2D plane for the most part."
}
```

**Classification:**

*   The graph exhibits properties of a **cyclic**, **grid**, **planar** topological structure. However, it is not classified as any of these but is instead more accurately described as a **mesh** or **grid-like lattice structure**, characterized by its 2D plane representation and comparatively low number of crossing edges between points.

Note that the provided JSON response considers primarily the inherent planarity of lattice structures with the provided edges while indicating the non-planar trait of the entire structure overall due to crossing edges and thus categorizes it as a "planar mesh".
