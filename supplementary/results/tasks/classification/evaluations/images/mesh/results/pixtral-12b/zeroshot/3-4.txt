The image shows a grid-like structure with vertices connected in a systematic manner. To classify this graph, we need to consider its properties:

1. **Acyclic**: This graph contains cycles, so it is not acyclic.
2. **Bipartite**: A bipartite graph can be split into two disjoint sets where no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. This graph doesnâ€™t satisfy this property as any vertex in one row can connect with vertices in adjacent rows, making it not bipartite.
3. **Complete**: A complete graph has every vertex directly connected to every other vertex. This graph does not fit this definition.
4. **Cyclic**: Since the graph has repeating paths (cycles), it is cyclic.
5. **Mesh**: A mesh graph is a type of grid or lattice structure where each vertex is connected to its neighbors in a systematic way. This graph fits the definition of a mesh.
6. **Planar**: A graph is planar if it can be drawn on a plane without edges crossing. This graph can be represented in a plane without edges crossing, so it is planar.
7. **Tree**: A tree is acyclic and connected. This graph is cyclic and not a tree.

Based on the analysis, the graph is classified as both cyclic and mesh.
