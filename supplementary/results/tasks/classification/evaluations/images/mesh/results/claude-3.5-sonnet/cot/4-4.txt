   "analysis": "The image shows a mesh graph because it consists of vertices arranged in a regular grid pattern (5x5) where each internal vertex is connected to its four adjacent neighbors (top, bottom, left, right), forming a lattice structure. The graph contains multiple cycles, has a regular repeating pattern of connections, and vertices are not fully connected to all other vertices. The graph also maintains consistent spacing and organization typical of mesh networks."
