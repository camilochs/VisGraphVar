To analyze the graph visualization step-by-step, we'll follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Check for Cycles

- **Observation**: Start and end points for each path are examined.
- **Conclusion**: The graph does not exhibit any cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex).

### Step 2: Examine Connectivity Pattern

- **Observation**: 
  - **All vertices connected to each other**: Not true, some vertices are not directly connected.
  - **Organization into distinct sets**: Not apparent.
  - **Hier structure**: Yes, the vertices are arranged in a hierarchical vertical structure, similar to a tree.

### Step 3: Look at Edge Crossings

- **Observation**: The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings.
- **Conclusion**: The graph is planar, meaning it can be drawn on a plane without edges crossing.

### Final Classification and Analysis

Given the hierarchical structure and absence of edge crossings, the most fitting classification is:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because the vertices are arranged in a hierarchical vertical structure, indicating a parent-child relationship, and the graph can be drawn without any edge crossings."
}
```
