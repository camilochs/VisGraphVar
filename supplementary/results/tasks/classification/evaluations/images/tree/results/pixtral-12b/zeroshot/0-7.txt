To classify the given graph, let's analyze the visual representation and identify the appropriate classification.

1. **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles. For example, the path 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 0 forms a cycle.

2. **Bipartite**: A graph is bipartite if it can be divided into two disjoint sets of vertices such that every edge connects vertices from different sets. This graph does not follow that property because some links like 0-4 and 4-5 do not respect this division. Therefore, it is not bipartite.

3. **Complete**: A graph is complete if every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. This graph is not complete because not all pairs of vertices are connected (e.g., 1 is not connected to 8).

4. **Acyclic**: An acyclic graph has no cycles. Since we've identified cycles in the graph, it is not acyclic.

5. **Mesh**: A mesh typically refers to a graph where every node is connected to every other node or in a specific structured manner. This graph does not follow a mesh structure.

6. **Planar**: A planar graph can be drawn on a plane in such a way that no edges intersect. Given its complexity and presence of many intersecting edges like in 0-4, 4-5-7, this graph is not planar.

7. **Tree**: A tree (or forest) is an acyclic connected graph. This graph has cycles and thus is not a tree.
