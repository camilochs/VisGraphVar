Let's analyze the graph displayed in the image:

1. **Acyclic**: The graph contains cycles, which means it is not acyclic.
2. **Bipartite**: The graph does not appear to have an independent set partition, which is a requirement foriteness.
3. **Complete**: The graph is not complete because not every pair of vertices are directly connected.
4. **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles, which indicates it is a cyclic graph.
5. **Mesh**: The graph is not fully connected in a grid manner, which is typical of mesh or hypercube structures.
6. **Planar**: The graph does not appear to be planar as the edges intersect, forming a complex structure.
7. **Tree**: The graph contains cycles and thus is not a tree, as a tree by definition is acyclic and connected.

Given the above analysis, the classification of the graph is cyclic.
