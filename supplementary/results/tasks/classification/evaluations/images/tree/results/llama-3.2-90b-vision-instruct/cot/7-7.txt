To determine the type of graph, we will follow the steps outlined in the prompt.

**Step 1: Check for cycles**
The graph does not contain any cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex). This means it is acyclic.

**Step 2: Examine connectivity pattern**
- All vertices are not connected to all other vertices.
- Vertices do not appear to be organized in distinct sets.
- There is no indication of a hierarchical structure.

**Step 3: Look at edge crossings**
The graph can be drawn without edge crossings.

**Conclusion**
Based on these observations, the graph matches the definition of a **tree** because it is acyclic and can be drawn planar (without edge crossings), and there is no indication of cycles, bipartiteness, completeness, or a mesh/regular grid pattern.

**Final Answer**
```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it is acyclic and can be drawn planar without edge crossings."
}
