After analyzing the graph visualization, it can be classified as a tree. Here is the JSON format for the classification:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph."
 }
```

Explanation:

1. **Tree**: This graph is a tree because it is connected, has no cycles, and every edge connects two vertices of different levels. Each vertex has exactly one parent vertex, except for the root vertex, which has no parent. This satisfies the properties of a tree.
