To classify the given graph, let's analyze its structure and properties:

- **Acyclic Graph**: A graph with no cycles, meaning there is no sequence of vertices that starts and ends at the same vertex. This graph contains cycles, so it is not acyclic.

- **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects vertices in different sets. Observing the graph, it is not clear that it can be distinctly divided into two stable sets. Thus, it is likely not bipartite.

- **Complete Graph**: A graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This graph does not connect every vertex to every other vertex, so it is not complete.

- **Cyclic Graph**: A graph that contains at least one cycle. This graph has cycles, so it is cyclic.

- **Mesh Graph**: A type of graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex. This graph is not a mesh as it doesn't connect every pair of vertices.

- **Planar Graph**: A graph that can be embedded in the plane, i.e., it can be drawn on a flat surface without any edges crossing. Given the complexity, it is difficult to infer without complex analysis; however, it does appear to be non-planar due to intersecting edges.

- **Tree**: A connected acyclic graph. This graph can be classified as a tree as it is connected and does not have any cycles.

Thus, based on the structure observed:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph."
