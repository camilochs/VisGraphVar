Let's go through the analysis step by step:

1. **Check for cycles:**
   - Observing the graph, there is a path that starts from vertex 1, goes through vertices 2, 4, 7, and then returns to vertex 1. Therefore, the graph contains at least one cycle.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern:**
   - The graph is not fully connected, meaning not all vertices are connected to one another. For example, vertices 0, 8, and 9 are only connected to vertex 4, while vertices 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 5, 0, 8 are connected forming various paths and not all pairs of vertices are directly connected.
   - The vertices do not form a distinct set, nor do they form a complete set where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Instead, the graph shows a somewhat hierarchical and connected structure from vertex 4.

3. **Look at the edge crossings:**
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, indicating it is planar.
   - There is no regular grid pattern, but vertices are organized in a hierarchical manner radiating from vertex 4.

### Final Classification

Based on the above observations, the graph can be classified as:
```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it contains cycles but can be drawn without edge crossings. The vertices are not fully connected, and the graph does not form a regular grid pattern or a complete graph but rather a hierarchical structure from a central node (vertex 4)."
}
