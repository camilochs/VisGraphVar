To determine the type of graph, we need to analyze its characteristics.

**Step 1: Check for cycles.**
The graph does not contain any cycles as there are no paths that start and end at the same vertex.

**Step 2: Examine connectivity pattern.**
In this graph, all vertices are connected but not all of them are directly connected to each other, so it's not a complete graph.

**Step 3: Look at edge crossings.**
The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings, and the edges do not form a regular pattern or grid.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the graph matches the characteristics of a tree because it is a connected graph with no cycles and can be drawn without any edge crossings.

**Final Answer:**
```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it is a connected graph with no cycles and can be drawn without any edge crossings."
}
