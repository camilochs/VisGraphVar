**Step 1: Identify the graph's properties.**

The graph visualization is depicted with 9 vertices labeled from 0 to 9 arranged such that non-adjacent vertices do not intersect. While the visualization displays multiple edges and some vertices are incident to multiple edges, it does not contain any loops or multiple edges. Furthermore, it also does not contain vertices that are incident only to 0 edges.

**Step 2: Determine if it has cycles.**

During graph traversal, we can see that this graph does not feature any cycles or closed paths. 

**Step 3: Determine if it is weakly connected.**

When subjected to Traversal Algorithms, all the connections are reachable. That is, a path in this graph exists between any pair of vertices.

- We have 9 Vertices and 10 Edges. By Cayley's Formula, if it were a Tree, it would have 8 edges.

**Conclusion**

This graph does not meet the requirements to be classified as a tree, therefore it must be listed as cyclic. The graph is also a fairly 'sparse' graph as the 9 vertices have a total degree of 20 (sum of degrees of all vertices * 2 = 2*|E|).
