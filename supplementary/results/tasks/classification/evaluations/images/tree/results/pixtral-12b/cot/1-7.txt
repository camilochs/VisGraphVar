To analyze this graph, we will follow the steps mentioned to determine its type.

1. Identifying cycles:
   - A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. By tracing the vertices manually, we can confirm whether any cycles exist.

2. Examining connectivity patterns:
   - All vertices are not connected to all other vertices.
   - Vertices do not appear to be organized in distinct sets.
   - The vertices do form a hierarchical or tree-like structure, as there is a single path between nodes that do not revisit vertices.

3. Checking for edge crossings:
   - This graph can be drawn without any edge crossings, which indicates it is planar.
   - The edges do not form a regular pattern or grid; the connections are more hierarchical.

Based on these observations:

- The graph does not have cycles, suggesting it is **acyclic**.
- The vertices are connected in a hierarchical manner without forming complete subgraphs or bipartite structures.
- The graph is planar since no edges cross.

Thus, the final classification and brief analysis in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because the vertices are connected in a hierarchical manner without cycles or edge crossings."
}
