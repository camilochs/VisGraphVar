**Analysis of the Graph Visualization**

The provided subfigure depicts a graph with 9 nodes and 8 edges. To classify the type of graph, we will analyze the structure of the graph in the subfigure.

**Adjacent Analysis Graphs**

Upon close inspection of the graph, it is evident that the graph contains cycles. A graph is considered cyclic if it contains a cycle, which is a path that begins and ends at the same node and passes through at least one other node. Since the graph in the subfigure contains a cycle, it can be classified accordingly.

**Answer**

```json
{
  "type_graph": "cyclic",
  "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph."
}
```

This classification is based on the presence of cycles within the graph structure, which aligns with the definition of cyclic graphs in graph theory.
