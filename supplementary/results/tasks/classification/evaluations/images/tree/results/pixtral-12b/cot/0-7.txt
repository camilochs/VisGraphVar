To analyze the graph and classify it, let's follow the provided steps:

1. **Check for Cycles**:
   - We need to look for paths that start and end at the same vertex to determine if the graph is cyclic.
   - Example path: Starting from vertex 0, we can go to vertex 4, then to vertex 5, then to vertex 9, and return to vertex 0 (0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 9 -> 0).

   This confirms the presence of cycles, so the graph is cyclic.

2. **Examine Connectivity Pattern**:
   - Not all vertices are connected to all other vertices. For example, vertex 1 is connected to only vertex 0.
   - Vertices are not organized in distinct sets or forming a grid pattern.
   - There is no hierarchical structure as some vertices have multiple non-adjacent paths to other vertices.

3. **Edge Crossings**:
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, suggesting it is planar.

Given these observations, the appropriate classification based on each characteristic is a planar graph.

**Final Classification:**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it contains cycles, vertices are not fully connected to each other, exhibit a non-hierarchical structure, and can be drawn without edge crossings."
}
