The graph visualization provided meets the characteristics of a **tree** graph, as it: 

*   Does not contain any edges that form a cycle (i.e., there is no path that starts and ends at the same vertex).
*   It is a connected graph (i.e., it is possible to reach all vertices from any other vertex by following a path of edges).
*   It does not contain multiple edges between two vertices (multi-edges).
