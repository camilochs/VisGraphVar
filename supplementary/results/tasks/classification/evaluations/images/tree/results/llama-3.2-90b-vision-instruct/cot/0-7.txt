**Answer:**

I'm sorry, but I'm unable to display an image and conduct an analysis based on it, as I'm a large language model that does not have the capability to visually perceive or access images, nor can I generate them.

However, I can provide you with general information on the steps to determine a graph's classification, and explain possible outcomes.

Here are some key points to consider when classifying a graph:
1. A graph is considered acyclic, if it has no path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A tree, for example, is an acyclic graph with no cycles.
2. A graph is bipartite if its vertices can be separated into two distinct sets, such that all edges only connect vertices between those sets, but never within the same set.
3. A graph is considered complete, if every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
4. A graph is cyclic if it has a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
5. A graph is called a mesh if its vertices can be arranged in an ordered sequence in such a way that each "k-hop" distance for (k>0) connects exactly two vertices. E.g. "2-hop" distances would mean the graph forms hexagons (2 vertices distant, 3 edge distances).
6. A graph is planar, if it can be drawn in one plane, such that no edges intersect, or with the least amount of edge crossings.
7. A graph is considered a tree, if it is acyclic, connected and has, per the number of vertices "n",  exactly "n-1" edges.

A JSON structure for each of these classifications is provided below:
