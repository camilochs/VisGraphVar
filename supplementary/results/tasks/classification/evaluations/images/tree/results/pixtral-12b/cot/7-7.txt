To analyze the graph visualization and classify its type, we will follow the steps outlined:

1. **Check for Cycles:** 
   - By examining the graph, we see that there is no path that starts and ends at the same vertex. This indicates that the graph is acyclic.

2. **Examine Connectivity Pattern:**
   - The vertices are not all connected to each other.
   - The vertices are organized in a hierarchical structure, with vertex 4 as a central node branching out to other vertices.

3. **Look at Edge Crossings:**
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings.
   - There are no regular patterns or grids formed by the edges.

Based on these observations, the category best matching the graph's structure is "tree".

### JSON Classification

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because the vertices are organized in a hierarchical structure, there are no cycles present in the graph, and it can be drawn without any edge crossings."
}
```
