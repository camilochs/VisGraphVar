   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it has no cycles (no paths that start and end at the same vertex), forms a hierarchical structure with branching paths, can be drawn without any edge crossings (is planar), and each vertex is connected to others through a single path creating a connected acyclic structure. The vertices and edges form a typical tree pattern with node 3 acting as a central branching point."
