**Classification Analysis**

To determine the type of graph, we will analyze it based on the provided steps.

**Step 1: Checking for Cycles**

Upon examining the graph, we notice that there are paths that start and end at the same vertex. Specifically, the path 2-0-4-3-8-6-2 forms a cycle.

**Step 2: Examining Connectivity Pattern**

The graph does not exhibit all vertices being connected to all other vertices, which would be a characteristic of a complete graph. Instead, vertices seem to be organized in distinct sets without a hierarchical structure.

**Step 3: Analyzing Edge Crossings**

The graph can be drawn with crossings, and the edges do not form a regular pattern or grid. 

**Conclusion**

Based on the presence of cycles and the organization of vertices into distinct sets without a complete or hierarchical structure, this graph is classified as a cyclic graph. The definition of a cyclic graph matches our observations.

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles such as the path 2-0-4-3-8-6-2 and vertices are organized in distinct subsets."
