Here is the classification of the graph in JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph."
}
```

Explanation:
A graph is *acyclic* if there are no paths which start and end at the same vertex and include equal to 2 or greater edges; this shown here meets that requirement.
A *bipartite graph* is one whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets \(U\) and \(V\) that every edge connects a vertex in \(U\) to a vertex in \(V\); this graph does not meet this requirement.
A *complete graph* is one where every vertex is connected to every other vertex; this shown here does not meet that requirement.
A *cyclic graph* is one that is not acyclic; this graph does not meet this requirement.
A *mesh graph* is a graph where all vertices are of degree two; this graph does not meet that requirement.
A *planar graph* is one which can be drawn in 2D with no intersecting edges; this shown here meets that requirement.
A *tree graph* is one which is acyclic and planar and whose graph contain no more than \(n-1\) edges. This shown here meets that requirement.
