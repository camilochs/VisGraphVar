   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it has no cycles (it cannot be traversed in a loop), there is a clear hierarchical structure with the vertex labeled 0 as the root node, vertices are not all connected to each other, and all terminal nodes (leaves) are detached by only one edge from its branch. Additionally, a tree can always be drawn without edges crossing, confirming it as a tree graph."
