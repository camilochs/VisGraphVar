To classify the given graph, we can analyze its structure and characteristics:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph. Tree graphs are connected acyclic graphs, which means there are no cycles and there is exactly one path between any two nodes."
}
```

Explanation:
- **Tree Graph**: The graph is a tree because it is connected and acyclic. There is exactly one path between any two nodes, and it meets the definition of a tree in graph theory.
