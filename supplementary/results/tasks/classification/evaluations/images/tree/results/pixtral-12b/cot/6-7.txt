To analyze the graph, we will follow the steps mentioned and classify the graph.

1. **Check for cycles:**
   - Let's trace the vertices to check for cycles:
     - Start at vertex 1, and follow the edges to vertices 5, 7, 4.
     - Move to vertex 0, then to vertex 9, and back to vertex 4.
     - Follow the same path (1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 4 -> 0 -> 9 -> 4).
     - There is no cycle here as vertex 4 is reached only once without forming a loop.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern:**
   - Vertices are not organized into distinct sets or connected in a hierarchical structure.
   - Vertices 3, 8, and 6 form a linear chain 3 -> 8 -> 6.
   - This pattern suggests a tree-like structure not coordinated into hierarchical levels.

3. **Look at the edge crossings:**
   - The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings, satisfying the definition of a planar graph.

### Final Classification and Analysis

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar, tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar, tree graph because it has no edge crossings and forms a hierarchical tree structure without cycles."
}
```

The graph does not show as a complete or regular grid structure, eliminating complete or mesh types. Its key characteristics indicate it is both a tree and planar.
