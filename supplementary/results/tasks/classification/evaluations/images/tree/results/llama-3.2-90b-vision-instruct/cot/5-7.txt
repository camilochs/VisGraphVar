**Step 1: Check for cycles in the graph**

The graph contains a cycle: 2->6->0->7->2. Therefore, it is cyclic.

**Step 2: Examine the connectivity pattern between vertices**

*   The graph does not have all vertices connected to all other vertices. For example, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 0, and vertex 3 is only connected to vertex 5.
*   There are no distinct sets of vertices based on their connectivity.
*   The graph does not form a hierarchical structure.

**Step 3: Look at the edge crossings**

*   The graph can be drawn without edge crossings.
*   The edges do not form a regular pattern or grid.

**Step 4: Determine the type of graph**

Based on the analysis, the graph is a cyclic graph because it contains a cycle (2->6->0->7->2) and does not exhibit the characteristics of other types such as bipartite, complete, mesh, planar, or tree graphs.
