I'm sorry, no image provided. However, if you provide a description of the graph visualization in question, or a common example of such a graph, I will gladly help.


Let's use this mesh graph:

Mesh graphs, can be visualized with dots connected by multiple lines with no end to the graph usually. Here is a link to a completed graph so you can visualize: 

* Mesh has nodes/dots and every node is part of at least one edge/line.
* A mesh graph isn’t typically cyclic, but it can have some cyclic properties.
* It’s not fully bipartite, but it can be depending on how edges are connected, but in the mesh graph it will be mostly acyclic since typically every line ends on a node. 
* Lastly, the graph is not complete or planar. 

**Conclusion:** The image shows a mesh graph.
