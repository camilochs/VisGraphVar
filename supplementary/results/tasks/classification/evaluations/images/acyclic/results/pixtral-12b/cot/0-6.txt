Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. **Check if the graph contains any cycles:**
   - There appears to be a path starting from vertex 1 to vertex 3 and back to vertex 1, indicating a cycle in the graph.
   - There is also a path from vertex 2 to vertex 3 to vertex 0 and back to vertex 2, indicating another cycle.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern:**
   - The vertices are not connected to every other vertex, so the graph is not complete.
   - The vertices are not organized in distinct sets, so the graph is not bipartite.
   - The vertices do not form a hierarchical structure, so the graph is not a tree.

3. **Look at the edge crossings:**
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, indicating it is planar.
   - The edges do not form a regular pattern or grid, ruling out the mesh type.

Based on this analysis, the type of the graph can be determined.

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic, planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic and planar graph because there are cycles in the paths connecting vertices and the graph can be drawn without any edge crossings."
}
