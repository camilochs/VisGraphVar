Let's analyze the graph step by step according to the given criteria:

1. **Check for cycles:**

   - The graph has a vertex (node) labeled 0, which connects to vertices labeled 1, 2, and 3.
   - Vertices 1, 2, and 4 do not form a cycle with vertices 0, 3, and 5.
   - These connections suggest that there are no cycles in the graph.

2. **Connectivity pattern:**

   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1, 2, and 3.
   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 4, and 5.
   - This indicates a tree-like structure originating from vertex 0 and branching out to vertices 1, 2, and 3.
   - Vertex 3 further branches out to vertices 4 and 5.

3. **Edge crossings:**

   - The graph can be drawn without edges crossing.
   - There are no repeated edges between any two vertices, suggesting a lack of cyclic elements.

Based on these observations, the graph does not exhibit any cycles, does not connect all vertices to all other vertices (thus not a complete graph), and forms a hierarchical structure originating from vertex 0 and branching out as a tree.

   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it has a clear hierarchical structure originating from vertex 0 and branching out to vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without any cycles or repeated edges."
