   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles (loops) that start and end at the same vertex. The connectivity pattern does not form a complete, bipartite, or hierarchical structure. The graph is not planar as it contains edge crossings. It does not form a regular pattern or grid, and it is not a tree since it contains cycles."
