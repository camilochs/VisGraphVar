**Step 1: Identify the graph.**

The provided image is a simple graph. It initially depicts a line from vertex 0 to vertex 1, then from vertex 1 to vertex 2, then from vertex 2 to both vertex 3 and vertex 0 (causing a loop in the graph). It continues, leaving vertex 3 to get to vertex 4 and finally vertex 5.

**Step 2: Characterise the graph.**

1.  **Acyclic:** We notice a cycle starting from the upper-left 0 and moving CCW to 1->2->3->0. We conclude this is a cyclic graph.
2.  **Bipartite:** The graph doesn't draw clear partitions amongst its vertices. We conclude this is not bipartite.
3.  **Complete:** There are missing connections between 0 and 4 as well as 0 and 5 as well as 3 and 5. Therefore, this is not a complete graph.
4.  **Mesh:** This refers to a fully connected graph. We can see that its missing a connection between points 0 and 5 as well as 3 and 5. This is not a mesh graph.
5.  **Planar:** Since its possible to draw the graph on a page without corralling lines around eachother, we conclude this is a planar graph.
6.  **Tree:** Trees need to be a collection of nodes that have no cycle. Yet, we've already seen that this contains a cycle. Therefore this is not a tree.

**Step 3: Summarize the graph using JSON and this summarization.**

```json
{
  "type_graph": "Cyclic & Planar",
  "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic & planar graph because it has no disconnected vertices and contains a cycle. Additionally drawings without crossings are possible."
}
```

**Conclusion:**

The included graph is both cyclic and planar, due to the intermittent connectivity and cycle pattern. And by having no line crossings, it allows for conclusions about the imagery properties. This exercise showed the importance of carefully getting to know the graph during the planning stage to then later make informed decisions about the relationships between graph connections and nodes relevant to the objective.
