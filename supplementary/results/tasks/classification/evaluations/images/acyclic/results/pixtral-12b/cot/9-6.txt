To analyze the graph and classify it, we'll follow the steps mentioned:

1. **Check for cycles (roads that start and end at the same vertex)**:
   - The graph contains vertices connected with directed edges:
     - Vertex 0 connects to vertices 1, 2, and 3.
     - Vertex 1 connects to vertices 3 and 5.
     - Vertex 2 connects to vertex 3.
     - Vertex 3 connects to vertex 4.
     - Vertex 5 connects to vertex 1.
   - Observing the connections, there are paths that loop back or cross, forming cycles: e.g., 0 -> 3 -> 0, 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 1, and 3 -> 4 -> 3.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern**:
   - **All vertices connected to all other vertices**: Not entirely. Some vertices, like vertex 5, connect to fewer vertices.
   - **Vertices organized in distinct sets**: There is some clustering between specific vertices but not in distinct, separate sets.
   - **Vertical structure**: The arrangement has a somewhat hierarchical flow, especially from vertex 0 down to other vertices.

3. **Edge crossings**:
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, indicating it is **planar**.

Based on these observations, the types "acyclic," "bipartite," "complete," "cyclic," "mesh," and "tree" are not applicable because the graph has cycles, a non-complete connection, and hierarchical clustering. However, it is planar and somewhat tree-like but not strictly acyclic.

Final JSON classification:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn without any edge crossings, and it exhibits a certain hierarchical structure. Additionally, it includes cycles meaning it is neither acyclic nor a tree."
}
