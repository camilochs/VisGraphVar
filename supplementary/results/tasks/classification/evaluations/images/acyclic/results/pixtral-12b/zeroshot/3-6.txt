Let's analyze the given graph based on its properties:

1. **Acyclic**: The graph does not contain any cycles. Each node has its own directed path without any loops.
2. **Bipartite**: The graph does not satisfy the necessary condition for being bipartite, which is that vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.
3. **Complete**: Few vertices don't connect to every other vertex, so the graph is not complete.
4. **Cyclic**: Since the graph contains no cycles, it is acyclic.
5. **Mesh**: The graph is not a mesh since it does not form a regular grid topology.
6. **Planar**: The graph receives no overlapping edges when drawn on a plane.
7. **Tree**: The graph is connected and has no cycles, with \( n \) vertices and \( n-1 \) edges, which makes it a tree.

Based on this analysis:
