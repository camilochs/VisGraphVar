To classify the graph visualized in the image, let's analyze the key characteristics:

1. **Acyclic**: No cycles exist in the graph; there is a directed path from the start vertex to all other vertices.
2. **Bipartite**: A graph can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.
3. **Complete**: Each pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique directed edge.
4. **Cyclic**: Contains at least one cycle, where it is possible to start and end at the same vertex following a sequence of edges.
5. **Mesh**: Every vertex is connected to every other vertex (complete graph).
6. **Planar**: The graph can be placed on a plane so that no edges intersect except at their endpoints.
7. **Tree**: An acyclic, connected graph with no cycles.

Given the analysis:
- The graph has no cycles, which indicates it is acyclic.
- There are no two disjoint sets in which every vertex connects to every vertex in the other set but not within the same set. Therefore, it is not bipartite.
- It does not represent a complete graph either since not every pair of vertices is connected by a unique directed edge.
- The graph is directed and acyclic (DAG), indicating it is a tree as well.
