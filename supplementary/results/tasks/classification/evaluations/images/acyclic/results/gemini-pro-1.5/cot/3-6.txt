  "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn without any edge crossings. It contains a cycle (0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0), so it is not acyclic or a tree.  It is not bipartite because there are cycles of odd length. It is not complete as not all vertices are connected to each other. Lastly, there isn't a uniform connectivity pattern across the graph to be considered a mesh."
