   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle formed by vertices 0->2->3->1->0. Additionally, the graph has branches extending from vertex 3 to vertices 4 and 5, but the presence of the cycle makes it definitively cyclic rather than a tree or acyclic graph. The graph is also planar as it can be drawn without edge crossings."
