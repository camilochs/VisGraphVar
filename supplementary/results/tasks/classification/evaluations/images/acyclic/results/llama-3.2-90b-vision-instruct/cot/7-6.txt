**Classification and Analysis Step-by-Step**

To classify the graph, we use the provided steps:

### Step 1: Checking for cycles.

*   In the given graph, there is no path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
*   **Graph does not contain any cycles.**

### Step 2: Analyzing the connectivity pattern.

*   The graph shows vertices (5) connected by edges such that no vertex is isolated, and there is a path between every pair of vertices.
*   However, not all vertices are connected to every other vertex directly.
*   **Graph is connected, but not fully connected.**

### Step 3: Examining edge crossings.

*   The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings, adhering to a hierarchical structure with no isolated vertices or subsets.
*   **Edges can be represented without crossings, indicating a planar and connected structure.**

Given these observations, we identify this as a **tree graph**. This determination is founded on the following:

###  Final Classification and Analysis:

{
   "type_graph": "Tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it is connected, lacks cycles, and maintains a hierarchical structure without edge crossings."
