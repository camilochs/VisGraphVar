  "type_graph": "planar",
  "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn without any edge crossings. It is not acyclic as there are cycles (e.g., 0-2-1-3-0). It is not complete as not every vertex is connected to every other vertex. It is not bipartite as the vertices cannot be partitioned into two sets where edges only connect vertices between the sets (e.g., the cycle 0-3-1-0 makes it impossible). It is not a mesh because edges do not form a regular grid. It's not a tree as it contains cycles. And it's not cyclic solely as it isn't the only defining characteristic. Thus, 'planar' is the best classification."
