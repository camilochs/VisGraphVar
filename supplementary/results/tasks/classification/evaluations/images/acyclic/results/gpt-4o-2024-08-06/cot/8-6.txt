   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains a cycle involving vertices 0, 2, and 3. The graph does not have all vertices connected to each other, it is not organized into bipartite sets, nor does it form a hierarchical structure typical of trees. The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, but it is not complete, mesh, or planar in the required senses."
