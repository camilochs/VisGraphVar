**Step 1: Identify the Graph Properties**

*   The graph is planar (easy to verify by observing the graph).
*   The graph is cyclic (easy to verify by observing the graph).

**Step 2: Conclusion**

*   The planar property does not restrict the graph from being cyclic.

**Conclusion:**

The image shows a cyclic graph.

**Answer:**
