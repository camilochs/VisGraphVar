   "type_graph": "acyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows an acyclic graph because all edges are directed and there are no paths that start and end at the same vertex. The graph has a directed structure with vertices 0 and 3 serving as central nodes connecting to other vertices in a way that prevents any cycles from forming. All paths flow outward without returning to their starting points."
