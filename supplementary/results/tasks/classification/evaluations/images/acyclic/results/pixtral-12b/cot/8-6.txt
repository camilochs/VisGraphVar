To classify the graph provided in the image, we need to examine its characteristics based on the given steps. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Cycle Analysis:**
   - Checking for cycles involves tracing paths in the graph to see if they eventually return to the starting vertex.
   - The graph contains the following vertices and edges: 1 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 3 -> 2.
   - By tracing paths:
     - 1 -> 3 -> 4 and then returning has no return path.
     - 1 -> 3 -> 5 also doesn't return.
     - 1 -> 3 -> 2 suggests a potential cycle if backtracked from 3 through another path to 1.
   - There is indeed a cycle in this graph.

2. **Connectivity Pattern:**
   - Vertices are not fully connected to each other.
   - Vertices don't form distinct sets.
   - Vertices don't form a hierarchical structure.

3. **Edge Crossings:**
   - The graph has no edge crossings, indicating it could be drawn on a plane without overlaps.

Based on these observations, we can classify the graph.

**Classification Summary:**
```json
{
   "type_graph": "cylic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because despite vertex 1 -> 3 -> 2 indicating a back trackable path, the graph forms a cycle. No distinct hierarchical or fully connected pattern is observed; moreover, there are no edge crossings, suggesting a planar organization."
}
```
This conclusion is supported by identifying a cycle in the graph, while its linear structure without crossings points towards being planar albeit cyclic.
