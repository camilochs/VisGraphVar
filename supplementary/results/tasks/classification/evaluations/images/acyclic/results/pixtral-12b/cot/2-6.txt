Let's evaluate the graph using the specified steps:

1. **Checking for Cycles:**
   - By following the directed edges, we can see cycles appear in the graph. For instance, if we start at vertex 0 and follow the edges, we can reach vertices 3, 1, and 0 again. This indicates that there's at least one cycle in the graph.

2. **Examining Connectivity:**
   - The vertices are not fully connected, but there are several paths connecting them.
   - The vertices do not form an organized linear or hierarchical structure.
   - The vertices can be divided roughly into a lower set (vertices 2, 0, and 3) and an upper set (vertices 1 and 5), but this isn't distinctlyite.

3. **Edge Crossings:**
   - The graph is not planar as the edges cross in several places, indicating complex interconnections.

Given these observations, the graph does not fit into the tree,ite, planar, or complete graph categories.

### Conclusion:
The graph can best be classified as **cyclic** due to the presence of cycles and the irregular connections between vertices.

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains paths that start and end at the same vertex, indicating the presence of cycles. The connectivity pattern is not hierarchical and edge crossings prevent it from being planar."
}
