To classify the graph visualized in the image, let's analyze its characteristics:

1. **Acyclic**: The graph contains cycles (e.g., 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 forms a cycle with 0 -> 3), so it is not acyclic.
2. **Bipartite**: Aite graph can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. This graph does not satisfy this property because some vertices (e.g., 0 and 3) are connected directly.
3. **Complete**: A complete graph has an edge between every pair of vertices. This graph does not have edges between every pair of vertices.
4. **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles, confirming it as cyclic.
5. **Mesh**: A mesh graph is another term for a complete graph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This graph does not satisfy this property.
6. **Planar**: A planar graph can be drawn on a plane in such a way that no edges intersect except at their endpoints. This graph does not appear to be planar due to the complexity of the intersections.
7. **Tree**: A tree is a connected acyclic graph. This graph contains cycles, so it is not a tree.

Based on the above analysis, the classified type of this graph is "cyclic."
