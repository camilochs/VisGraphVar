   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle between nodes 1 and 3, where there are edges going both directions between these vertices. The graph also has additional nodes (0, 2, 4, and 5) connected by directed edges, but the presence of the cycle between nodes 1 and 3 makes this a cyclic graph."
