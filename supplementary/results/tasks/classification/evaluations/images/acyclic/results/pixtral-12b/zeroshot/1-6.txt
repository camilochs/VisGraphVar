To classify this graph, I'll carefully analyze its structure:

1. **Acyclic**: There are no directed cycles in the graph.
2. **Bipartite**: The graph is notite since you can't divide the vertices into two stable sets without adjacent vertices between sets.
3. **Complete**: Not all vertices are connected, so it is not complete.
4. **Cyclic**: There is a cycle in the graph, so it's cyclic.
5. **Mesh**: The graph does not form a grid structure; hence, it is not a mesh.
6. **Planar**: The graph needs to be drawn on a plane without edges crossing for it to be planar. This graph seems abbreviate to be planar with crossings.
7. **Tree**: The graph has cycles and more than one path between some nodes, hence, it's not a tree.

Based on this analysis, the graph is classified as **cyclic**.
