To classify the given graph, let's analyze its characteristics.

1. **Acyclic**: The graph contains cycles, so it is not acyclic.
2. **Bipartite**: A graph isite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. This graph cannot beite because it contains odd cycles (which is obvious from the directed edges forming a loop between some of the nodes).
3. **Complete**: A complete graph has every pair of distinct vertices connected by a unique edge. This is not the case here.
4. **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles, so it is cyclic.
5. **Mesh**: This graph does not exhibit the “each node connected to all nodes in both breaks” characteristic of a mesh.
6. **Planar**: A non-planar graph cannot be drawn on a plane without edges crossing. This graph has edges that cross, so it is not planar.
7. **Tree**: A tree is a connected acyclic graph. This graph is connected but contains cycles, so it is not a tree.

Based on the analysis, the correct classification is "cyclic."
