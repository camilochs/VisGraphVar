Let's analyze the given graph step by step.

1. **Check for cycles**: 

   - A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
   - The path from `0` to `2` to `1` back to `0` creates a cycle.
   - Therefore, the graph contains cycles.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern between vertices**:

   - The vertices are connected in a structured manner, forming paths and loops.
   - This structure is not fully connected (complete).
   - The vertices are not distinctly divided into sets as in a bipartite graph.
   - There is no clear hierarchical structure seen easily.

3. **Look at the edge crossings**:

   - The graph does have edge crossings. For example, edges from `1` to `3` and from `2` to `1` cross.
   - The vertices are connected in a more complex manner rather than forming a regular or grid-like pattern (mesh).
   - The graph can be drawn without too many crossings (some simpler graphs like trees do not have many crossings if any).

Based on these observations:

#### Classification:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it has at least one cycle, indicated by the path from `0` to `2` to `1` back to `0`. The connectivity pattern is not hierarchical or fully connected (complete), and the graph has edge crossings, excluding it from being planar or a mesh."
