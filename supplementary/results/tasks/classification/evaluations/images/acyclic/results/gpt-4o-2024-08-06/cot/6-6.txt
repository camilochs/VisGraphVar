   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because there is a cycle present (3 -> 1 -> 3). The graph does not have all vertices connected to all others, so it is not complete. It is not bipartite as it doesn't have two distinct sets without internal connections, and it is not a tree since it contains cycles. The graph may be planar, but it cannot form a regular grid pattern associated with mesh networks."
