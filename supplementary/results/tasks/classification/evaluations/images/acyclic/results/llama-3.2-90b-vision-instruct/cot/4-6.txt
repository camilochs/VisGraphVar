To determine the type of graph, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Presence of Cycles**: A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. Looking at the graph, there are paths that form cycles (e.g., from vertex 0 to 1 to 2 and back to 0). Therefore, the graph contains cycles.

2. **Connectivity Pattern**:
   - **Complete Graph**: In a complete graph, every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex. In this graph, not all vertices are directly connected to each other (e.g., vertex 4 is not directly connected to vertices 0, 1, or 2). So, it's not a complete graph.
   - **Bipartite Graph**: A bipartite graph's vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects two vertices from different sets. This graph does not fit this criterion because some vertices are connected to vertices within what would seem to be the same set based on the drawing alone. However, without explicit sets, we cannot definitively classify it as bipartite based solely on the diagram provided.
   - **Tree Structure**: A tree is an acyclic connected graph. This graph contains cycles, so it does not meet the criteria for a tree.

3. **Edge Crossings**: The graph as illustrated does not exhibit edge crossings in a way that would define it as either planar or non-planar based solely on the image. A planar graph can be drawn in a plane such that no two edges intersect except at their vertices. Given the simplicity of the drawing and the absence of edge crossings, one might infer planarity, but this characteristic alone doesn't determine if it's a specific type like planar.

Based on these observations:

- The presence of cycles rules out classifications like "tree" and implies it could be cyclic.
- Not all vertices connecting directly makes it incomplete.
- The lack of clear bipartiteness or specific structure mentioning distinct sets in the prompt makes classifying it strictly as bipartite challenging without further context.
- The apparent lack of edge crossings doesn't necessarily fit with the other types under consideration here.

Given the steps provided and focusing on the key characteristics noted (cycle presence, connectivity patterns, and edge crossings), the most straightforward classification based on the provided criteria and avoiding projections outside what's directly observable from the image would lean towards identifying it as cyclic due to the presence of cycles. However, the analysis steps specifically requested classifications of acyclic, bipartite, complete, cyclic, mesh, planar, or tree, with an emphasis on characteristics that align with static graph theory definitions. Thus, focusing strictly on characteristics defined and inferred directly from the provided steps and image details:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains paths that start and end at the same vertex, indicating the presence of cycles."
}
```

This conclusion is drawn from the direct application of the steps provided for analysis, prioritizing adherence to the instruction format over additional speculative interpretations not explicitly covered by the analysis steps.
