To classify the graph shown in the image, let's go through the steps mentioned:

1. **Check for cycles**:
    - Start at vertex 0.
    - Move to vertex 1.
    - Move to vertex 2.
    - Move to vertex 3.
    - Move to vertex 5.
   This path `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5` forms a cycle. Therefore, the graph is not acyclic.

2. **Examine connectivity**:
   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 2.
   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0 and 3.
   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 0.
   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1 and 4.
   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 3.
   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 3.
   - Vertices are not connected in a regular or bipartite manner. There is no hierarchical structure either.

3. **Look at edge crossings**:
    - The graph is drawn in such a way that no edges cross, which indicates it is planar.
    - It does not form a complete or mesh pattern.

**Final Classification**:
- The graph is planar and cyclic based on the analysis above.

**JSON Format**:
```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar and cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar and cyclic graph because it contains cycles and can be drawn without any edge crossings."
}
```
