   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains a cycle (0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0). The vertices are not all connected to each other, they do not form distinct sets, nor a hierarchical structure. The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, but the presence of a cycle classifies it as cyclic."
