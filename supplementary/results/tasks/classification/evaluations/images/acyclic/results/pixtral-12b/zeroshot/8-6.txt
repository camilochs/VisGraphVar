To analyze the graph visualization, let's review the properties of different types of graphs to identify the correct classification.

1. **Acyclic**: A graph that has no cycles.
2. **Bipartite**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other.
3. **Complete**: A graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
4. **Cyclic**: A graph that has at least one cycle.
5. **Mesh**: A fully connected graph on \(n\) vertices, similar to a complete graph \(K_n\).
6. **Planar**: A graph that can be embedded in the plane without any edges crossing.
7. **Tree**: A connected acyclic graph.

Upon examining the given graph visualization:

- The graph is connected and includes cycles (e.g., a loop from vertex 4 to 1).
- The graph is not complete because not every vertex connects to every other vertex.
- The inability to find two disjoint sets of vertices where every vertex connects only to vertices in the other set indicates that it is notite.
- The avoidance of edge crossings suggests it is planar.

Given the analysis, the graph is classified as **Planar**.
