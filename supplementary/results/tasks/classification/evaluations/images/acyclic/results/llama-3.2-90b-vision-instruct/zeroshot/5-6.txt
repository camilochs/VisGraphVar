**Step 1: Identify the key characteristics of each graph type.**

*   **Acyclic:** A graph with no cycles, meaning it does not contain any closed loops or paths that start and end at the same vertex.
*   **Bipartite:** A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.
*   **Complete:** A graph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
*   **Cyclic:** A graph that contains at least one cycle, indicating the presence of a closed path.
*   **Mesh:** A graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex, similar to a complete graph but may have additional edges beyond direct connections.
*   **Planar:** A graph that can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings.
*   **Tree:** An acyclic graph with exactly one path between each pair of vertices.

**Step 2: Analyze the given graph visualization based on these characteristics.**

*   The graph has vertices labeled 0 through 5.
*   It contains edges connecting these vertices in a manner that forms a single loop involving vertices 0, 1, 3, 2, and back to 0.
*   There are no direct connections between all pairs of vertices, ruling out being complete or a mesh.
*   The presence of the loop indicates it is cyclic.
*   The graph does not have every vertex connected to every other vertex, ruling out being complete.
*   There are no indications suggesting divisibility into two disjoint sets for bipartite graphs.
*   The graph can be drawn without edge crossings on a plane, making it planar.
*   The existence of cycles rules out being an acyclic tree.

**Conclusion:**

Given its properties, the graph is best classified as cyclic and planar. However, since "cyclic" directly answers the question while "planar" describes a characteristic rather than a classification type from the options provided, the focus should be on identifying it as cyclic.
