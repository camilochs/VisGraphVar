**Step 1: Identify the properties of the graph.**

The image depicts a graph with five vertices (labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and eight edges. The edges are directed, indicating a direction from one vertex to another.

**Step 2: Define the terms used for classification.**

*   **Acyclic Graph:** A graph that does not have any cycles; i.e., graph that contains at least one cycle is called cyclic graph.
*   **Bipartite Graph:** A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.
*   **Complete Graph:** A graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex.
*   **Cyclic Graph:** A graph containing a cycle.
*   **Mesh Graph:** A graph whose each vertex has a connection to every other vertex except itself and it's immediate neighbors.
*   **Planar Graph:** A graph that can be drawn in a plane such that edges do not intersect at any point other than the vertices of the graph. At most two edges share only their end vertex and do not intersect otherwise.
*   **Tree Graph:** A tree is a special type of graph (mathematical meaning) in which no more than two undirected edges can connect a pair of vertices. Mathematically, a tree is a cycle-free graph.

**Step 3: Compare the properties with the graph in the diagram.**

*   **Acyclic Graph:** The graph contains cycles, hence it is not acyclic.
*   **Bipartite Graph:** The vertices cannot be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.
*   **Complete Graph:** Each vertex is not connected to every other vertex in the graph.
*   **Cyclic Graph:** There is a directed edge between nodes in both directions. However, this is not essential; a graph can be cyclic even if it is undirected and has a cycle (a path from vertex A to vertex B with vertex A also reachable by a path from vertex B), e.g., a loop from a node back onto itself.
*   **Mesh Graph:** There is no connection between every vertex and every other vertex except itself and its immediate neighbors.
*   **Planar Graph:** The graph cannot be drawn without intersecting edges, although it is impossible to determine whether the graph is planar without actually attempting to draw it.
*   **Tree Graph:** It contains more than two undirected edges connecting pairs of vertices.

**Step 4: Conclude the type of graph.**

According to the classification criteria, and despite not being able to tailor the graph into a planar one, the provided undirected graph can be classified as a cyclic non-planar multigraph.
