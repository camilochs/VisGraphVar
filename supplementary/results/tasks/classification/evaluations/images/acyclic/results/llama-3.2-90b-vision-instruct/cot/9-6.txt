**Step 1: Check for cycles**

The graph contains a cycle: 0 → 2 → 3 → 0.

**Step 2: Examine connectivity**

* Not all vertices are connected to all other vertices.
* Vertices are not organized in distinct sets.
* The graph does not form a hierarchical structure.

**Step 3: Analyze edge crossings**

* The graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings.
* Edges do not form a regular pattern or grid.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, the graph is classified as a cyclic graph.

*Answer*:
