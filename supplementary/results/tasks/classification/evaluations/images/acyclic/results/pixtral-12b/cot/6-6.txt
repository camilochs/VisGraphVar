To analyze the graph in the image, we'll consider each characteristic carefully and determine its type. Below is the step-by-step analysis.

1. **First, check if the graph contains any cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex):**
   - The graph is:
     - `0 -> 3`
     - `0 -> 2`
     - `2 -> 4`
     - `3 -> 1`
     - `3 -> 5`
   - To check for cycles, we can start a path from any vertex and return to it.
     - Start from `0`, then go to `3`, then to `1`, then back to `3`, then to `5`, again back to `3`, and finally return to `0`.
   - This indicates that there is a cycle in the graph.

2. **Next, examine the connectivity pattern between vertices:**
   - The vertices are not all connected to all other vertices, and the connections are not organized in a hierarchical structure.
   - There are no two distinct sets where vertices do not cross each other.

3. **Look at the edge crossings:**
   - The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings, meaning it is a planar graph.
   - The edges do not form a regular mesh or grid pattern.

Based on these observations, the graph can be classified as a planar graph because it can be drawn in the plane without any edges crossing.
