**Classification of the Graph**

To classify the graph, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Check for Cycles**

A cycle in a graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. In this graph, there are cycles present, as we can trace a path from any vertex back to itself by traversing the edges connecting it with other vertices.

**Step 2: Examine Connectivity Pattern**

In this graph, not all vertices are connected to all other vertices. However, all vertices are part of a continuous structure where one can move from any vertex to any other vertex through the edges. There are no distinct sets of vertices isolated from each other, nor do they form a clear hierarchical structure.

**Step 3: Consider Edge Crossings**

The graph does contain edge crossings, which means it cannot be drawn without these crossings in a two-dimensional space.

**Conclusion**

Based on the presence of cycles without the graph being complete (every vertex connected to every other vertex), bipartite (vertices divided into two disjoint sets), forming a mesh (regular pattern resembling a net), or structured like a tree (hierarchical, with no cycles), and considering the presence of edge crossings making it non-planar, we conclude that the graph is cyclic and thus can be classified as a cyclic graph.

**Final Classification and Analysis in JSON Format**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "Cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains paths that start and end at the same vertex, is not complete or bipartite, does not form a hierarchical structure, and has edge crossings which deny it being a tree or planar graph."
