To classify the graph in the image, we need to examine its structure and properties.

1. **Acyclic**: The graph does not contain any cycles. A cycle is a path of vertices where the start and end vertices are the same, with all vertices being distinct. In this graph, each path from any vertex leads to a single destination without returning to the starting vertex.

2. **Bipartite**: The graph cannot be divided into two disjoint and independent sets of vertices such that every edge connects vertices from these two sets. This graph has several paths that do not allow for such a division.

3. **Complete**: The graph is not complete because not every vertex is connected to every other vertex. For example, vertex 2 is only connected to vertex 0, while vertices 5 and 4 are only partially connected.

4. **Cyclic**: The graph does not appear to have any simple cycles, making it acyclic.

5. **Mesh**: This graph does not have a connectivity property that satisfies mesh requirements, such as a fully connected subgraph.

6. **Planar**: The graph does not exceed the limits of being planar, but it also does not strictly adhere to a planar graph's properties. For example, vertices 0 and 2 form a triangular structure which could imply complexity if further edges are added.

7. **Tree**: The graph follows a hierarchical structure without any cycles, which is characteristic of a tree.

Given these points, the classification of the graph is straightforward.
