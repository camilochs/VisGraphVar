  "analysis": "The image shows a planar cyclic graph. It is planar because it can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings. It's cyclic because it contains cycles; for example, 0-1-2-0 is a cycle. It is not a tree because it contains cycles. Neither is it complete as not all vertices are connected with each other. It is not bipartite as it contains cycles of odd length (e.g., 0-1-2-0), and it is not a mesh as it is not just comprised of interconnected triangles."
