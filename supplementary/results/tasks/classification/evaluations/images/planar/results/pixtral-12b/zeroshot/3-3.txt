}
```

Explanation:
- The graph has a clear, hierarchical structure with nodes connected in a way that each node, except the root, is connected to exactly one other node.
- There is no cycle present, as each path through the graph leads to distinct nodes.
- The graph is acyclic and spans multiple levels from a single root node to the leaf nodes.

Therefore, the graph can be classified as a tree.
