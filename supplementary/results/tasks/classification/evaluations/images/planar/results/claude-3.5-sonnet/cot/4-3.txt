Let me analyze this graph according to the given steps:

1. Cycle check:
- Looking at the connections, there are indeed cycles formed by vertices (e.g., 0-2-1-0)

2. Connectivity pattern:
- Not all vertices are connected to each other
- Vertices form a triangular pattern with numbers 0, 1, and 2 forming the base
- Each additional vertex (3-9) connects to both vertex 0 and 2

3. Edge crossings:
- The graph as shown has no edge crossings
- It can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing
- This makes it a planar graph

4. Based on these observations, while the graph contains cycles and has a somewhat regular pattern, its key characteristic is that it can be drawn without edge crossings.

{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings, while maintaining all vertex connections. The graph forms a triangular fan-like structure with vertices 3-9 connecting to both vertices 0 and 2, creating a series of triangular faces."
}
