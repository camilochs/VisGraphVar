Let's analyze the graph step by step to determine its type.

1. **Check for cycles**: Start and end points for each path.
   - The paths from vertex 0 to vertices 3 through 9 clearly indicate a hierarchical structure.
   - There are no loops or back paths that close a cycle within this structure.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern**:
   - **Connectivity**: Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1, 2, and each from 3 to 9. This shows it is not fully connected in a way that each vertex connects to every other vertex.
   - **Organization**: Vertices 3 to 9 form a linear chain structure from vertex 0, suggesting a hierarchical and acyclic nature.
   - **Distinct sets**: There is no indication of vertices organized in distinct sets (which aligns withite graphs).

3. **Edge crossings**:
   - The edges are drawn without crossings, indicating the graph is planar.
   - Each edge from the top goes downward without crossing other edges.

Based on these observations, we can determine the type of the graph.
