   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because there are multiple paths that start and end at the same vertex, forming cycles. The vertices are all connected directly or indirectly, contributing to these cycles. The graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings, and there is no hierarchical or grid structure evident."
