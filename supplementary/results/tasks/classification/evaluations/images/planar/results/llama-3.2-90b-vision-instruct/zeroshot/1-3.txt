**Graph Classification**

To classify the given graph, let's analyze its properties:

*   **Acyclic**: An acyclic graph does not contain any cycles.
*   **Bipartite**: A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.
*   **Complete**: A complete graph is a graph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
*   **Cyclic**: A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle.
*   **Mesh**: A mesh graph is a type of planar graph that consists of vertices connected by edges in a way that forms a grid-like structure.
*   **Planar**: Planar graphs are drawn in a plane in such a way that no edge intersections occur. They are graphs that can be drawn in a plane without edge crossings.
*   **Tree**: A tree is an acyclic connected graph.

The given graph is connected but contains cycles. It is not bipartite because there are direct connections between nodes that could potentially be in the same set. It is not complete since not every node is directly connected to every other node. It does not form a mesh structure. The graph is planar as it can be drawn without any edge intersections.

Given these observations, the graph is classified as **planar** and **cyclic**. Since the question format suggests a single classification, focusing on the unique aspect that distinguishes it from others:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph."
}
