   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles formed by vertices connected in triangular patterns. For example, vertices 0-1-2 form a cycle, and additional cycles are created with each numbered vertex (3 through 9) connecting to vertices 0 and 2, forming multiple triangular cycles. The graph also appears to be planar as it can be drawn without edge crossings, but the presence of cycles is its defining characteristic."
