Let me analyze this graph according to the given steps:

1. Cycle check: This graph contains several triangular cycles. For example, vertices 0-1-2 form a triangle, and there are multiple triangles formed with the numbered vertices.

2. Connectivity pattern:
- Not all vertices are connected to all others
- Vertices are arranged in a specific triangular pattern
- Vertices 0, 1, and 2 form a base triangle, with other vertices connected to these base vertices

3. Edge crossings:
- The graph as shown has no edge crossings
- The edges form a triangular mesh pattern
- The graph can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings

Based on these observations:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings, forms a triangular mesh pattern, and while it contains cycles (triangles), all edges can be arranged without intersections. The vertices are arranged in a specific geometric pattern that maintains planarity."
}
