{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple triangular cycles, such as those formed between nodes (0, 1, 9), (0, 2, 3), and others. The graph also indicates connections that do not fully connect every vertex to every other vertex but rather allows pathways that loop back, forming cycles."
