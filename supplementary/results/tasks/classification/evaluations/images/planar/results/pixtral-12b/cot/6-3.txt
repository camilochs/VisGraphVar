Let's analyze the given graph step by step according to the specified characteristics:

1. **Contains any cycles**: 
   - Examining the structure, we see that there are no loops (self-effects) and no repeating paths that start and end at the same vertex. Therefore, the graph does not contain any cycles.

2. **Connectivity pattern**:
   - All vertices from 3 to 9 are directly connected to the vertex labeled 0.
   - The vertices form a hierarchical structure, with vertex 0 at the bottom and vertices 3 to 9 cascading upwards from it.
   - Vertices 1 and 2 are not directly connected to vertices 3 to 9 but are linked to vertex 0.

3. **Edge crossings**:
   - The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings, indicating it is planar.

Given these observations, the graph does not have cycles, has a clear hierarchical structure, and can be drawn without edge crossings.
