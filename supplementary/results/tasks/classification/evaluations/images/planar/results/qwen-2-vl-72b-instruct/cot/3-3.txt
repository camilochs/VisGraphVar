{
   "type_graph": "acyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows an acyclic graph because there are no cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex) in the graph. The vertices are organized in a hierarchical structure, with each vertex having a unique parent and child relationship, which is characteristic of a tree. There are no edge crossings and the graph appears planar."
