**Graph Classification**

To classify the graph, we follow the provided steps:

### Step 1: Check for Cycles

There are no cycles in the graph. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, passing through at least one other vertex. Since this graph doesn't have any loops that start and end at the same point by visiting other vertices along the way, it is acyclic.

### Step 2: Examine Connectivity Pattern

*   **Complete Graph:** In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This graph does not meet this criterion as not all vertices are directly connected to all other vertices.
*   **Bipartite Graph:** A bipartite graph has its vertices divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects two vertices from different sets. There's no clear division into two sets based on how edges connect vertices here.
*   **Tree:** A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, and all vertices in a tree are connected. However, this graph displays a hierarchy where vertices are organized in a way that suggests some form of branching structure, but it does not meet the strict definition of a tree due to its complexity and the presence of multiple connections.

### Step 3: Analyze Edge Crossings

*   **Planar Graph:** A planar graph can be drawn in a plane such that no two edges intersect except at their endpoints. This graph appears to be planar as it does not require edges to cross each other to illustrate its structure.
*   **Mesh:** A mesh graph involves edges connecting vertices in a pattern resembling a regular grid or mesh. This graph does not display such a regular connectivity pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis:

*   The graph is acyclic.
*   It doesn't fit the definitions of complete, bipartite, or tree graphs strictly due to its structure.
*   It is planar as edges do not need to cross to represent it accurately.
*   It doesn't display a mesh structure.

Given these characteristics, the graph is best described as a planar graph because it can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings, and it does not satisfy the criteria for other graph types mentioned.

**Final Answer:**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be represented in a two-dimensional space without any edge crossings and does not meet the criteria for other specified types."
}
