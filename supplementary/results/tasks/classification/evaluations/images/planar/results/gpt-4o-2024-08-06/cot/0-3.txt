   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles, evident from paths that start and end at the same vertex, such as the triangle formed by vertices 0, 1, and 2. It does not exhibit a complete or bipartite structure, nor does it form a hierarchical (tree) or mesh pattern. The edges intersect when connected, suggesting it is non-planar in this drawing."
