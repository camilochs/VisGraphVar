   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles, such as the one formed by vertices 0, 1, 2, and 9. Not all vertices are connected to each other (so it's not complete), and it doesn't form a hierarchical structure (so it's not a tree). The graph is planar because it can be drawn without edge crossings."
