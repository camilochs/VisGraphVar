   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles formed by the triangular paths between vertices. For example, there are cycles formed by vertices (0,1,2), (0,2,3), (0,2,4), and so on. The graph has a fan-like structure where vertices 3 through 9 are connected to both vertex 0 and their adjacent numbered vertices, creating multiple triangular cycles throughout the structure."
