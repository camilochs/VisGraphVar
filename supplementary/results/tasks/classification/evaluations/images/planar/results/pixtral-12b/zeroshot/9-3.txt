To classify the given graph, let's analyze its properties step by step:

1. **Acyclic**: The graph contains directed connections and loops, indicating it is not acyclic.
2. **Bipartite**: Aite graph has two disjoint sets of vertices such that every edge connects a vertex from one set to a vertex in the other set. The given graph does not strictly have two disjoint sets of vertices, hence it is notite.
3. **Complete**: In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This graph is not complete because some vertices are not directly connected to each other.
4. **Cyclic**: The presence of directed loops confirms that the graph is cyclic.
5. **Mesh**: A mesh (or r√©sultat graph) involves all-to-all connectivity. This is not true in this graph.
6. **Planar**: Planar graphs can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. The intricate interconnections in this graph prevent it from being planar.
7. **Tree**: A tree is a connected acyclic graph. This graph is not acyclic as it contains cycles.

Based on the above analysis, the graph can be classified as cyclic.
