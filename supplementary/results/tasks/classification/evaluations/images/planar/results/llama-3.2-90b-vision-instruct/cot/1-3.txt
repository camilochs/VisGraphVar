The graph has cycles, but all nodes are not connected to every other node. This degree of connectivity shows that the graph doesn't qualify as either bipartite or complete. While most edges do not cross, edges in the lower triangle can be re-drawn without crosses for the entire graph.

Based on the hierarchal node numbers, the graph's structure most resembles a tree-like structure. A tree graph is defined as a *connected*, *acyclic*, and *undirected graph*.

In contrast, this graph is not acyclic, therefore it cannot be classified as a tree graph even with the striking similarities.

{
 "type_graph": "planar",
 "analysis": "The image shows a planer graph because it can be drawn without edge crossings."
}
