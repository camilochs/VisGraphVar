   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles formed by vertices connected in triangular patterns. For example, vertices 0-1-2 form a triangle, and there are multiple cycles formed by paths through the numbered vertices (3 through 9) connecting back to vertices 0 and 2. The graph has a fan-like structure where each vertex from 3 to 9 connects to both vertex 0 and forms part of a path leading to vertices 1 and 2, creating multiple cyclic paths throughout the structure."
