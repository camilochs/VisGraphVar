Let's analyze the graph in the image step-by-step:

1. **Check for cycles:**
   - Start and end points appear to be the same for certain paths, indicating the presence of cycles.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern:**
   - The vertices are not all connected to each other.
   - The vertices are organized in a hierarchical structure, forming a tree-like pattern where a central vertex has branches connecting downwards.

3. **Look at the edge crossings:**
   - There are minimal or no edge crossings.
   - The edges are organized without forming a regular pattern.

Given the observations:

- **Cycles**: The graph contains cycles.
- **Connectivity pattern**: The vertices are organized in a hierarchical manner, resembling a tree.
- **Edge crossings**: The lack of edge crossings indicates the graph can be drawn on a plane without intersections.

Based on this analysis, the type of this graph is likely a **tree**. 

Here is the JSON-output with the analysis:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it contains cycles, the vertices are organized in a hierarchical manner, and the graph can be drawn without edge crossings."
}
