Let me analyze this graph following the given steps:

1. Checking for cycles:
- The graph contains several triangular cycles (e.g., 0-1-2-0, 0-2-3-0, etc.)

2. Examining connectivity:
- Not all vertices are connected to all others
- Vertices are not organized in distinct sets
- There's a pattern where vertices 0, 1, and 2 form a triangle, and other vertices connect to vertices 0 and 2

3. Edge crossings:
- The graph can be drawn without edge crossings as shown
- The edges form a fan-like pattern from vertices 0 and 2

4. Final classification:
This is a planar graph, as it can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings.

   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings. It has a distinctive triangular base (vertices 0-1-2) with additional vertices (3-9) connected to vertices 0 and 2 in a fan-like structure, maintaining planarity throughout."
