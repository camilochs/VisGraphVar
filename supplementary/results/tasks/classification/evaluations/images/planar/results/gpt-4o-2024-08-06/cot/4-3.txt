   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles, such as the one formed by vertices 0, 1, and 2. All vertices are not connected to all other vertices, so it is not complete. It is not a tree due to the presence of cycles. The graph is planar as it can be drawn without edge crossings."
