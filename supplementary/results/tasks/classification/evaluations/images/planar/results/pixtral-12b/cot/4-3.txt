Let's analyze the graph by following the specified steps:

1. **Check if the graph contains any cycles**: 
   - A cycle would mean a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, such as tracing back to the start after visiting zero or more vertices. We observe that in the graph, each vertex connects to the central vertex labeled 0. There is a path from vertex 3 to 0 and back to 4 (3 -> 0 -> 4), indicating a cycle. However, the cycles are limited to connections from the root vertex (0) reverting to another tier vertex, which is characteristic of a hierarchical tree.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern between vertices**:
   - All vertices (3 to 9) directly connect back to the central vertex (0), creating a cascading or hierarchical structure where each vertex 3 to 9 leads to the central vertex 0.
   - Vertices are not organized in distinct sets; they follow a tree-like hierarchy.
   - The connectivity pattern implies a tree structure without cycles among tiered vertices.

3. **Look at the edge crossings**:
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings since it follows a tree-like, hierarchical structure. 
   - There is no regular grid or mesh formation; vertices radiate from the central vertex.

Based on these observations:

- **Type of the graph**: The graph is acyclic and characterized by a hierarchical, tree-like structure.
- **Full hierarchy**: Each vertex connects directly back to a central vertex, which is a defining feature of a tree structure.

The final JSON classification is as follows:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it has hierarchical layers where all vertices connect to a single central vertex without any cycles, displaying a clear parent-child relationship common in tree structures."
}
