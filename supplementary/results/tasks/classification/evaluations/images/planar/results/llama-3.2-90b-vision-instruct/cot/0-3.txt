**Step 1: Determine the type of graph that the given image belongs to.**

The image shows a simple cyclic graph.



**Step 2: Describe the graph in the JSON format.**

```JSON
{
   "type_graph": "acyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows an acyclic graph because it contains no cycles."
}
```

However, the final classification concludes incorrectly that the image represents an acyclic graph, whereas the cyclical graph image suggests otherwise. To correct this, the correct classification would be "cyclic". Following this logic, and in compliance with the specified JSON formatting, the image classification is provided in the corrected JSON format below.



**The final classification is:**

{ "type_graph": "cyclic",

   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because a cycle path begins and ends at the same vertex." }
