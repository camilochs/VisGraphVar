Let me analyze this graph following the given steps:

1. Cycle check:
- The graph shows multiple triangular shapes, which technically form cycles (e.g., 0-2-1-0, 0-2-3-0, etc.)

2. Connectivity pattern:
- Not all vertices are connected to all other vertices
- The vertices are numbered from 0-9
- Each vertex (except 0, 1, and 2) connects to form triangles with vertices 0 and 2
- Shows a systematic pattern but not strictly hierarchical

3. Edge crossings:
- The graph can be drawn without edge crossings as shown
- The edges form a fan-like pattern from vertices 0 and 2

Based on these observations, I can provide the classification:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn on a plane without any edge crossings, and while it contains multiple triangular cycles, all edges and vertices are arranged in a way that no edges need to intersect. The fan-like structure maintains planarity while connecting all vertices."
}
```
