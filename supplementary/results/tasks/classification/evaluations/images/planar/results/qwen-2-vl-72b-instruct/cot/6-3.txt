   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn without any edge crossings, even though there are multiple edges connecting the same vertices. This graph has a radial structure with a central vertex (vertex 0) and other vertices symmetrically arranged around it. The lack of edge crossings indicates that it is not a mesh, cyclic, or complete graph."
