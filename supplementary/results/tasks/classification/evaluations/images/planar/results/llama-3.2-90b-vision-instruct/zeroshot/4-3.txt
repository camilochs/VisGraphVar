The given image depicts a graph with 9 vertices (0 to 8) and 18 edges. The graph is undirected, as there are no arrowheads at the end of the edges.

**Properties of the Graph**

* The graph contains no self-loops or multiple edges between any two vertices.
* It is connected, as there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex.

**Cycles in the Graph**

* The graph has a cycle (e.g., 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3), excluding it from being a tree or DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
* It is connected and has a cycle, excluding it from being a DAG.

**Classification of the Graph**

* The graph is undirected and connected.
* It contains cycles but does not have multiple edges between any two vertices.

**Conclusion**

Based on the above points, we may classify the graph as a planar, cyclic graph. However, without having more information about whether the graph can be drawn in a plane without any edge intersections, we cannot give a definitive answer without one supposing. For simplicity, if we suppose the graph is drawn without any edge intersections, then it would be a planar graph. Nevertheless, at minimum, the image shows a cyclic graph.

*Answer*: 

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph drawn in a plane without intersecting edges, so it is a planar graph. The graph is connected, but as it has a cycle, it is a cyclic graph, and it cannot constitute a tree or DAG."
}
```

This answer is under the assumption the graph is drawn without intersecting edges. Otherwise, it can be simply said that "The image shows at minimum, a cyclic graph."
