Here is the analysis of the graph visualization:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn on a plane without any edges intersecting."
}
```

Indeed, the graph can be drawn on a plane without any edges intersecting, making it a planar graph.
