Let's follow the steps to analyze the graph:

1. **Check for Cycles**:
   - The graph does not have any cycles. There are no paths that start and end at the same vertex. This can be observed by following each path from a vertex to its connected neighbors and noting that it does not loop back to the starting vertex.

2. **Examine Connectivity Patten**:
   - The graph has a hierarchical structure where vertex 0 serves as the central node and is connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Vertices 3 through 9 are connected hierarchically to vertex 0, forming a tree-like structure.

3. **Edge Crossings**:
   - The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings. Vertices are organized in a way that minimizes edge crossings naturally.

Based on the observations:

- The graph does not contain any cycles, which rules out being cyclic or planar.
- It is not fully connected (every vertex is not connected to every other vertex), ruling out being a complete graph.
- There is no distinct bipartite structure where nodes can be partitioned into two sets, ruling out being bipartite.
- There is a hierarchical structure, which suggests a tree structure.
- It does not form a mesh or grid pattern.

Therefore, the graph is a tree.

Here is the classification in JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it has a hierarchical structure with one central node connected to other nodes without any cycles or edge crossings."
}
```
