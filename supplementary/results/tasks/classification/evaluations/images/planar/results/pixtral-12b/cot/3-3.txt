Let's go through the analysis steps to determine the type of this graph.

1. **Checking for Cycles:**
   - The graph contains vertices numbered 0 to 9. Vertices 4 to 9 are connected to vertex 0. Vertices 3 to 6 are connected to vertex 4, and so on. There does not appear to be any paths that start and end at the same vertex within this hierarchical structure, indicating it is **acyclic**.

2. **Examining Connectivity Pattern:**
   - All vertices from 1, 2, and the hierarchy from 3 to 9 connect only to vertex 0. Vertices are organized in a single branch (a hierarchical structure leading up from vertex 0), which indicates it is likely a **tree**.

3. **Edge Crossings:**
   - Upon drawing the graph visually, there are no edge crossings.
   - This property suggests that it can be drawn in a **planar** manner without any edge intersections.

### Final Classification and Analysis:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree, planar, acyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree, planar, and acyclic graph because it contains no cycles, follows a hierarchical structure from the vertex 0, and can be drawn without any edge crossings."
}
