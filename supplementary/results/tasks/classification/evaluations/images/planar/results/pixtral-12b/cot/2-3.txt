Let's begin the analysis to determine the type of the given graph.

1. First, check if the graph contains any cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex):
   - The graph does not contain any cycles. Starting from any vertex and traversing through edges always leads to a unique path without looping back to the starting vertex. This indicates the graph is acyclic.

2. Next, examine the connectivity pattern between vertices:
   - The vertices are arranged in a hierarchical structure, forming levels from the root vertex 0 to the leaf vertices at level 9. This pattern is typical of a tree structure.
   - Vertices are not entirely connected to each other, but follow a parent-child relationship.
   - There are no distinct or unrelated sets of vertices; rather, they form a single path from the root to the leaves.

3. Look at the edge crossings:
   - The graph does not have any edge crossings because it can be drawn in a plane without overlapping lines.
   - The edges are arranged in a way consistent with a hierarchical or ancestor-descendant relationship, typical of tree structures.

Given these observations, the graph resembles a hierarchical structure without cycles, with vertices arranged in a distinct parent-child pattern.

Final classification and brief analysis:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it is acyclic, arranged in a hierarchical structure with a distinct parent-child relationship among vertices, and can be drawn in a plane without edge crossings."
}
