   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles formed by the interconnected vertices. For example, there are triangular cycles formed by vertices (0,1,2), (0,2,3), (0,2,4), and so on. The vertices are arranged in a triangular pattern with multiple edges connecting to vertices 0 and 2, creating several closed paths that start and end at the same vertex."
