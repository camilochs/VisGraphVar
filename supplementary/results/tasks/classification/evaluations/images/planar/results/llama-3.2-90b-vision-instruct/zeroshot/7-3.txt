Based on the analysis of the graph visualization, the final answer is:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph."
}
```

* The graph available in the image comprises various nodes (represented by numbers, ranging from '0' to '9') and edges to connect them. The following steps illustrate these findings in detail:

* A tree with n data elements will have n-1 edges for its connection.
In this scenario, there are nine nodes that are interconnected by eight edges.

* This confirms that the image shown is a tree, considering it establishes a hierarchy between its various first-class citizenships (nodes).

* As per the illustration in the image, the parent node features children nodes, none which the children can have other children nodes connected to them.
