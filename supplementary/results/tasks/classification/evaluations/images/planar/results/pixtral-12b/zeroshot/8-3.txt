To analyze the graph and classify it, let's go through the given options:

1. **Acyclic**: The graph contains no cycles. This means there's no way to start at a vertex and follow a sequence of edges that eventually loops back to the starting vertex.

2. **Bipartite**: The graph's vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets such that every edge connects a vertex from one set to a vertex from the other set. The graph does not have an odd-length cycle.

3. **Complete**: Every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the graph.

4. **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles (i.e., you can start at a vertex, follow a sequence of edges, and eventually loop back to the starting vertex).

5. **Mesh**: A graph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The given graph does not follow this pattern as some vertices do not connect to every other vertex.

6. **Planar**: The graph can be embedded in the plane without edges crossing. This requires a more detailed examination, but generally, if cycles can be avoided from overlapping, it can be considered as a planar graph.

7. **Tree**: A connected acyclic graph. It has the maximum number of vertices with \( n - 1 \) edges where \( n \) is the number of vertices.

From the visual inspection of the provided graph image, we can deduce the following:

- The graph starts at a root vertex \( 0 \) and branches out to vertices \( 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \), ..., \( 9 \).
- Vertices \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) connect directly back to vertex \( 0 \).
- There are no cycles visible in the diagram (indicating it's acyclic).
- It does not appearite due to the edges connecting back to a single vertex \( 0 \) from multiple endpoints, thus violating theite property.
- It isn't a complete graph because not every vertex connects to every other vertex.
- The pattern does not exhibit a mesh as each vertex does not connect to every other vertex.
- It can be considered a tree because it is acyclic and connected.
- The graph does not cross itself in planar form, therefore it is also planar.

Therefore, the graph can be classified as both **tree** and **planar**.
