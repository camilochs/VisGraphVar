   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles formed by the interconnected vertices. Specifically, there are triangular cycles formed by vertices 0-2 connecting to various other numbered vertices (3 through 9). The vertices are arranged in a triangular pattern with multiple paths that start and end at the same points, creating several cycles. The graph also appears to be planar as it can be drawn without edge crossings, but the dominant characteristic is its cyclic nature due to the multiple closed loops in its structure."
