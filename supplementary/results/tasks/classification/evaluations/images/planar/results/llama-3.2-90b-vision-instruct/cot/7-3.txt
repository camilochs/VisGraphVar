**Classification of the Graph**

The graph is classified as a *Planar Graph* based on the following analysis:

* The graph is acyclic, meaning it contains no cycles.
* The graph is not complete, as not all vertices are connected to every other vertex.
* The graph is not bipartite, as it does not consist of two disjoint sets of vertices such that every edge connects two vertices from different sets.
* The graph is not a tree, as it does not have a hierarchical structure with a single root node.
* The graph is planar, as it can be drawn in a plane without edge crossings.

**Conclusion**

The final classification and brief analysis of the graph in JSON format are:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "Planar Graph",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn in a plane without edge crossings and does not contain any cycles or a hierarchical structure."
}
