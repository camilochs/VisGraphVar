**Classification: Cyclic**

Based on the examination of the graph, the following observations have been made:

*   There are multiple edges that form a loop, indicating that the graph contains cycles.
*   The presence of cycles suggests that the graph is not a tree or an acyclic graph.

The graph structure corresponds to the attributes of a cyclic graph.
