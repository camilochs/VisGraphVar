  "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn without any edge crossings.  It is not acyclic as paths like 3-0-3 exist. It isn't complete as not every vertex is adjacent to each other (e.g. 1 and 3 are not). It is not bipartite as odd length cycles exist. It does not have the regular connectivity of a mesh. Nor is it a tree, in part because the existence of cycles means it isn't acyclic. "
