To analyze the graph and classify it, let's evaluate its properties against the common graph types:

- **Acyclic**: The graph contains cycles. For example, we can see a cycle involving nodes \(0, 1, 2, 0\).
- **Bipartite**: The graph is not bipartite because it contains odd cycles.
- **Complete**: The graph lacks edges between every pair of vertices, so it is not a complete graph.
- **Cyclic**: The graph is cyclic, as there are several cycles within it.
- **Mesh**: The graph does not have a structure that полностью connects all vertices to its neighbors in a grid-like manner.
- **Planar**: The graph is not planar; it has crossings due to the complex interconnections of the edges.
- **Tree**: The graph has more than one path between some pairs of vertices, disqualifying it as a tree.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting classification is "cyclic."
