**Property/Concept:** Classification of Graph

**Data:**

* Visual representation of a graph with nodes and edges

**Solution:**

To classify the graph, let's analyze its properties:

* The graph does not contain any cycles (a path that starts and ends at the same node). Therefore, it is **acyclic**.
* The graph has a single connected component. Therefore, it is **connected**.
* The graph does not contain any isolated nodes (nodes with no edges). Therefore, it is **non-isolated**.
* The graph does not contain any self-loops (edges that connect a node to itself). Therefore, it is **simple**.

Based on these properties, we can conclude that the graph is an **acyclic** graph.

**Conclusion:**
