To determine the classification of the graph shown in the image, let's analyze its properties:

1. **Acyclic**: The graph contains cycles (for example, 0 to 1 to 3 to 0). It is not acyclic.
2. **Bipartite**: The graph does not have an equalition since the nodes are interconnected in a way that they do not divide into two disjoint sets of vertices where every edge connects a vertex from one set to another. The presence of multiple cycles indicates it is notite.
3. **Complete**: The graph is not complete because there are missing edges that would be required to connect every pair of nodes.
4. **Cyclic**: The graph contains cycles, which makes it cyclic.
5. **Mesh**: The graph does not exhibit the total interconnection of mesh topology.
6. **Planar**: The graph can be drawn without edges crossing, which means it can be represented on a plane without edge crossings.
7. **Tree**: The graph does not have a single path from top to bottom; it contains many paths and cycles, which disqualifies it from being a tree.

Upon analyzing these properties, the correct classification for the graph in the image is **planar**:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph."
}
