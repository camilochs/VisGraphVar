**Graph Classification**

To determine the type of graph, we analyze its characteristics:

* **Cycles**: The graph contains several paths that start and end at the same vertex, indicating the presence of cycles. Therefore, it is a cyclic graph (Step 1).

* **Connectivity Pattern**:
	+ Not all vertices are connected to every other vertex, so it's not complete.
	+ There are no distinct sets of vertices, ruling out bipartite.
	+ The structure does not form a hierarchical tree-like structure, meaning it's not a tree.

* **Edge Crossings**: With six edge crossings, the graph cannot be drawn without them. This characteristic rules out planar graphs and meshes.

Based on these observations, the graph does not fit neatly into traditional categories like acyclic, bipartite, complete, mesh, planar, or tree due to the presence of cycles, edge crossings, and its connectivity pattern. However, given the instructions, the closest match based on the key characteristic identified (the presence of cycles) would be considered cyclic, even though this analysis primarily focused on ruling out other categories.
