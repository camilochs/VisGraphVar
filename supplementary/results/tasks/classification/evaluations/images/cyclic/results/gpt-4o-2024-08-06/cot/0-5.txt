   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles, such as the path 0 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 0. Not all vertices are connected to all others, eliminating it as complete, and there aren't distinct sets or a hierarchical structure, ruling out bipartite, tree, and mesh. Edge crossings suggest it could potentially be drawn without crossings, but the presence of cycles is the defining characteristic."
