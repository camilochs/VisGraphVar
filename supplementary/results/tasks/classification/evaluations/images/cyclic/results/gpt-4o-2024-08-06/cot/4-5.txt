   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles, such as the path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0. It is not a complete graph as not all vertices are connected to every other vertex, and it does not organize vertices in distinct sets or form a hierarchical structure. The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, indicating it is planar, but its defining feature is the presence of cycles."
