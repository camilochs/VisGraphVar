Let's analyze the graph step-by-step to determine its type.

1. Check if the graph contains any cycles:
   - A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating edges.
   - By tracing the edges, we can see that there are multiple paths that form loops, indicating the presence of cycles.
   
2. Examine the connectivity pattern between vertices:
   - Are all vertices connected to all other vertices?
     - No, vertices are not connected to all other vertices; some vertices are only connected to certain others.
   - Are vertices organized in distinct sets?
     - No, not all vertices are grouped in separate sets.
   - Do vertices form a hierarchical structure?
     - No, there are no clear hierarchical structures.

3. Look at the edge crossings:
   - Can the graph be drawn without edge crossings?
     - No, there are edge crossings in the given graph.
   - Do edges form a regular pattern or grid?
     - No, the edges do not form a regular pattern or grid.

Based on the observations:
1. There are cycles present in the graph.
2. The vertices are not fully connected and do not form distinct sets or hierarchical structures.
3. The graph has edge crossings and does not form a regular pattern.

The final classification of the graph is "cyclic," as there are paths that form loops, which characterizes it as cyclic.
