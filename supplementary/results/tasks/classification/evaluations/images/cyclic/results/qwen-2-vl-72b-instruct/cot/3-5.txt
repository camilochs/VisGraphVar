   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex). The vertices are not all connected to each other, nor are they organized into distinct sets or forming a hierarchical structure. The graph also has edge crossings, indicating it is not planar. Therefore, the classification of cyclic is the most appropriate."
