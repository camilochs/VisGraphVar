To analyze the graph, I need to identify key characteristics that correspond to each type of graph classification. Hereâ€™s the analysis based on the visualization provided:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph. Each node in the graph is part of at least one cycle (closed loop or circuit). This means that it is possible to start at a node, traverse through other nodes, and return to the starting node without lifting the pen (or pointer)."
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Cyclic**: This graph includes at least one cycle, such as the path starting from node 0 to 5 to 3 to 0, which forms a closed loop.
