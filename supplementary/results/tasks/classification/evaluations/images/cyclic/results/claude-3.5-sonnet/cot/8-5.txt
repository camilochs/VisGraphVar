{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles. One can trace paths that start and end at the same vertex (for example: 0->1->2->3->4->5->0 forms a cycle). The vertices are not fully connected to each other, nor do they form a hierarchical structure or bipartite pattern. The graph can be drawn with edges crossing, making it non-planar."
