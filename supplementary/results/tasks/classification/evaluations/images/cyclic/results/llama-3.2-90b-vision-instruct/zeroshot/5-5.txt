The provided instructions seem to be incomplete, as there is no image to analyze. However, I will follow the instructions to the best of my abilities.

**Classification:**

Without an image, it is impossible to provide a classification of the graph. 

**JSON Response:**

Since I couldn't analyze the graph, I will provide a response indicating that the request couldn't be fulfilled.

```json
{
   "type_graph": "[N/A]",
   "analysis": "No image was provided to be classified."
}
```
