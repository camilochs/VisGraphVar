To classify the graph, we'll follow the given steps:

1. **Check for cycles**: A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. In this graph, there are paths that begin and end at the same vertex (e.g., starting from vertex 1, moving to 2, then 3, back to 1), indicating the presence of cycles.

2. **Examine connectivity**:
   - **All vertices connected to all others?** No, not every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex.
   - **Vertices in distinct sets?** There's no obvious division into groups or bipartitions based on the connections shown.
   - **Hierarchical structure?** The graph does not clearly depict a hierarchical structure where vertices are arranged in a tree-like manner with a root and leaves.

3. **Edge crossings and patterns**:
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, indicating it is planar.
   - There's no regular pattern or grid formed by the edges.

Given these observations:

- The graph contains cycles.
- It's not complete, bipartite, a tree, or a mesh due to the lack of specific connectivity patterns.
- It can be drawn without crossings, making it planar.

**Answer**: 

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic planar graph because it contains cycles and can be drawn without any edge crossings, avoiding the complexity of overlying lines, and does not fit into the other categories based on its connectivity and structure."
}
