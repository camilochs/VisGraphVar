   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains a cycle, specifically a path that starts and ends at the same vertex (e.g., 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0). The connectivity pattern does not indicate a complete, bipartite, or hierarchical structure, and the graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings given the arrangement of vertices and edges. Additionally, it does not form a regular pattern or grid."
