Sure, let's go through the steps to classify the graph in the image.

1. **Contains any cycles**:
   - There is a cycle in the graph. The vertices 2, 3, and 4 form a triangle (cycle) with edges 2->3, 3->4, and 2->4.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern**:
   - The graph is not fully connected (complete). Not all vertices are connected to every other vertex.
   - Vertices are not strictly organized in distinct sets (bipartite).
   - There is no hierarchical structure (tree).

3. **Edge crossings**:
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings because it can be laid out in the plane without any edges intersecting.

Based on these observations, we can determine the classification.

{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because there are vertices that form cycles (e.g., the triangle formed by vertices 2, 3, and 4). The graph is not fully connected or bipartite and does not exhibit hierarchical structure, but it can be drawn without edge crossings."
