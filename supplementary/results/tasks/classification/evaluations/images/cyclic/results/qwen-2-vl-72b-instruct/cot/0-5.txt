   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles (loops) that start and end at the same vertex. For example, there is a cycle between vertices 0, 1, 2, and 3. The graph is not acyclic, bipartite, complete, mesh, planar, or tree because it does not meet the specific criteria for those types of graphs."
