Let's analyze the graph according to the specified steps:

1. **Check for Cycles:**
   - Follow each vertex to see if any path forms a loop.
   - Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
   - Paths: we see that starting from 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 forms a loop.
   - Presence of a cycle indicates that the graph is cyclic.

2. **Examine Connectivity:**
   - The graph is not fully connected.
   - Vertices are connected in different sets and ways:
     - 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0
     - 0 -> 3 -> 4
     - 3 -> 5
   - There are hierarchical and subset-type connectivities.

3. **Edge Crossings:**
   - The edges in the graph can be drawn without any crossings.
   - The pattern does not form a regular grid or mesh.

Given these observations, the graph is **cyclic** but notite, fully connected, a mesh, or fully planar. 

However, it doesn't readily fit into a strict "tree" or "complete" classification due to the presence of multiple connectivity subgraphs and cycles.

### Classification and Analysis

```json
{
   "type_graph": "Cyclic Graph",
   "analysis": "The image shows a Cyclic Graph because it contains at least one cycle ( recognizeable due to the loop starting from vertex 0 and ending at vertex 0). The connectivity pattern is hierarchical and multiple subsets, thus not fitting into strict classifications likeite, complete, or tree."
}
