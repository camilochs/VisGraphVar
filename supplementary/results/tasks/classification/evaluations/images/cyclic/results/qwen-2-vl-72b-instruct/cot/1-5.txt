   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex), such as the cycle formed by vertices 0, 1, 2, and 3. The graph is not complete, bipartite, hierarchical, or a regular grid. Additionally, the graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings."
