   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because the graph contains a cycle: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 0. It is not a complete graph as not all vertices are connected to each other. The graph does not have distinct vertex sets or a hierarchical structure. Although the graph appears planar without edge crossings, the presence of cycles indicates it is cyclic."
