**Step 1: Analyze if the graph contains any cycles or not**

The drawn graph contains two cycles: 3—4 and 0—2—1

*   Hence, it is not acyclic.
*   The graph does not have distinct vertex set.
*   It contains more than one edge which connects to a vertex.

**Step 2: Analyze the connectivity pattern between vertices**

By observing, there are two pathways from node 3 to node 2. Also, there is a pathway from node 2 to node 1, a direct edge from node 3 to node 1. From these, it is evident that there is no hierarchy formation in this graph.

**Step 3: Analyze edge crossings and motifs**

It is given that this is a small graph, edges can be drawn without any intersection as needed. For this small graph, all vertices cannot be connected through straight edges without having intersections. 

**Conclusion**

After analyzing the graph as mentioned above, it contains multiple pathways from one node to another and needs to be connected with angled edges. This implies that:

```JSON
{
    "type_graph": "cyclic",
    "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because there exists a cycle in the graph" 
}
```

**Final Answer**

The final answer is cyclic.
