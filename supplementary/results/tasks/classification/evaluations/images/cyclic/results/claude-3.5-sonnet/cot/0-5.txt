   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle that can be traced through vertices 0-1-2-3-0. The graph has directed edges forming a closed path, and there are multiple possible paths between certain vertices. The vertices are not organized in a hierarchical structure or complete pattern, and while the graph appears to be planar (can be drawn without edge crossings), its defining characteristic is the presence of cycles."
