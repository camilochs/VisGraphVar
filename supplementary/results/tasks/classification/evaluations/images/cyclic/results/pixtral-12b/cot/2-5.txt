Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. **Check for Cycles:**
   - By tracing the arrows, we can see that the graph starts from vertex 0 and follows the path: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3. This forms one cycle. Similarly, starting from 5, it looks like: 5 -> 4 -> 3. These two paths suggest the graph has cycles.

2. **Examine Connectivity Pattern:**
   - Vertices are not all connected to each other. Vertex 5 is not directly connected to vertices 0, 1, 2, or 4.
   - There isn't a clear hierarchical structure either.
   - The vertices are somewhat partitioned, but this does not satisfy the criteria for a bipartite graph.

3. **Edge Crossings:**
   - When visually inspecting the graph, there are no edges that cross each other, suggesting it could be planar.
   - The edges do not form a regular grid or mesh pattern.

Given these points, the graph has cycles and isn't fully connected nor does it have a clear hierarchical structure. Thus, a bipartite or complete classification seems inapplicable. The absence of edge crossings suggests a planar nature. Since it also has cycles but is not fully connected, it does not fall cleanly under the "tree" category.

**Conclusion:**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic and planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic and planar graph because it contains cycles and can be drawn without edge crossings."
}
