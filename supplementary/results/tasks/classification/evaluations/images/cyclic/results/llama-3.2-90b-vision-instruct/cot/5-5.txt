**Image Classification and Analysis**

To determine the type of graph represented in this graph visualization, we will carefully examine its structure using the provided steps.

**Step 1: Check for Cycles**
Upon examining the graph, there are edges connecting multiple vertices and forming closed loops. In particular, edges link three vertices in a closed loop.

**Step 2: Examine Connectivity Pattern**
The vertices are not connected to all vertices, instead forming a hierarchical structure and distinct sets of nodes with multiple connections between the vertices. There is a vertex that only connects multiple vertices, but it is not connected to all other remaining vertices. Thus, the graph is not a complete graph.

**Step 3: Look at Edge Crossings**
Upon further examination, edges do not form a regular pattern or grid and some edges intersect with edge crossings making the graph not planar.

Based on these observations, the graph is classified as a **cyclic graph** because it contains cycles and does not form a hierarchical structure or have other characteristics such as vertices connected to all other vertices or distinctive sets forming grid patterns. Due to these distinct patterns, none of the other classification types are accurate such as **acyclic**, **bipartite**, **complete**, **mesh**, **planar**, or **tree**.

This graph visualization is classified as a **Cyclic Graph**.
