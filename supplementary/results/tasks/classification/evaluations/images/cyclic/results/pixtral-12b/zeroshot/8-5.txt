{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph."
}
```

### Analysis:
The graph in the image contains 6 nodes connected in a hierarchical manner with no cycles. It starts from a root node labeled 0 and branches out, connecting to other nodes without any looping back. This hierarchical structure with no cycles confirms that it is a tree graph. A tree graph by definition is acyclic and every node except the root node has exactly one parent node.
