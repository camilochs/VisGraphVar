Let's go through the analysis steps to classify the graph:

1. **Check for Cycles**:
   - The graph contains cycles. The presence of vertices connected in such a way that they form loops indicates that this graph is cyclic.

2. **Examine Connectivity Pattern**:
   - The vertices are not connected to all other vertices, so it is not complete.
   - The vertices are organized in a loop or circular manner forming some cycles; it isn't about distinct sets organized in hierarchical structure, nor it is acyclic norite naturally.

3. **Edge Crossings**:
   - The image does show some edges crossing, indicating that the graph is not planar.
   - There is a somewhat linear or grid pattern noticeable in how certain vertices connect with others.

Based on the observations:

- The graph is **cyclic** because it contains loops.
- It is **not complete** as there are connections missing between many pairs of vertices.
- It is **not planar** for edge crossings exist.
- The graph doesn’t particularly exhibit the characteristics of a **mesh** (like a grid or square pattern fully connected) nor **bipartite** (clearly split into two disjoint sets).

Final classification and analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles (paths that start and end at the same vertex), vertices are not fully connected (hence it’s not complete), and there are edge crossings preventing it from being planar."
}
