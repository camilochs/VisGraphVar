Let's perform the analysis step by step to determine the type of the graph depicted.

1. **Checking for cycles:**
   - The graph contains vertices labeled from 0 to 5.
   - Observing the direction of the edges and the sequence of connections, we can see a cycle:
     - Start from vertex 0, follow paths: 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0.
     - Therefore, the graph is **cyclic**.

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern between vertices:**
   - The vertices are not all directly connected to each other. Vertex 0 connects to vertices 1, 2, and 3.
   - Vertex 5 connects only to vertex 4.
   - This implies that the graph is neither complete nor aite graph because some vertices are only connected to neighboring vertices.
   - The vertices do not form a hierarchical structure typical of a tree.
   
3. **Edge crossings:**
   - The graph can be drawn without edge crossings, as evident from the provided image.
   - Moreover, the edges do not form a regular pattern typical of a mesh graph, and no hierarchical organization defines a tree; hence, this graph cannot be classified as a mesh or tree.

Based on this analysis, the graph is cyclic and does not fit the complete,ite, or hierarchical structure. Therefore, we do not find it related to aite or mesh.

The relevant classification from the given options is a **cyclic graph**.

### Final Classification and Analysis

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains a cycle (a sequence of vertices connected by edges that starts and ends at the same vertex). The vertices are not fully interconnected, do not form distinct sets or hierarchical structures, and the graph can be drawn without edge crossings."
