   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles, specifically the path 0 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 0 and another cycle 0 → 2 → 1 → 0. The graph is not a complete graph as not all vertices are connected to each other, and it does not have distinct sets or a hierarchical structure that would classify it as bipartite or a tree. It can be drawn without edge crossings, but the structure and presence of cycles classify it best as cyclic."
