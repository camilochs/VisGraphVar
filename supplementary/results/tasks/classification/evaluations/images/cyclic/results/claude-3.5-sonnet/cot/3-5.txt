   "type_graph": "acyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows an acyclic graph because it contains directed edges that form no cycles (paths that return to their starting vertex). Following any path along the directed edges, it's impossible to return to a previously visited vertex. The graph also has a clear directional flow from some vertices (like 0, 1, and 5) towards others (like 3 and 4), which is characteristic of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)."
