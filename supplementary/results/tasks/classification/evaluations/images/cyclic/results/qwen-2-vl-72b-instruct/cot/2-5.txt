{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because there are paths that start and end at the same vertex, such as the path from vertex 0 to vertex 3 and back to vertex 0. Additionally, the graph is not complete since not all vertices are connected to all other vertices, and the edges do not form a regular pattern or grid. The presence of edge crossings indicates that it is not a planar graph."
