   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains paths that start and end at the same vertex, such as the cycle formed by vertices 3, 0, 4, 5, and back to 3. Not all vertices are connected to each other directly, and the graph does not have a hierarchical structure or distinct sets. It cannot be drawn without edge crossings, consistent with a cyclic graph."
