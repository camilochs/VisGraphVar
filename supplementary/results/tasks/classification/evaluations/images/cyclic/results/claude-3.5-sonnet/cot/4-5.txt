Let me analyze this graph following the given steps:

1. Checking for cycles:
- Following the directed edges, I can see a cycle: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0

2. Examining connectivity:
- Not all vertices are connected to all others
- Vertices are not organized in distinct sets
- There's no clear hierarchical structure

3. Edge crossings:
- The graph can be drawn with edges crossing
- Edges don't form a regular grid pattern
- The edges form directed connections creating at least one cycle

Based on these observations, here's my classification in JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle where vertices can be traversed following directed edges to return to the starting point (0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0). Additionally, the graph has directed edges and doesn't fit the patterns of other graph types like trees or complete graphs."
}
