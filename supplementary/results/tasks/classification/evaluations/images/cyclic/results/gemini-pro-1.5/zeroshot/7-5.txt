It is planar because it can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. It is not acyclic (because it's cyclic), bipartite (no clear two sets of independent vertices), complete (not all vertices are connected to every other vertex), mesh (not every vertex is connected to every other vertex), or a tree (because it's cyclic)."
