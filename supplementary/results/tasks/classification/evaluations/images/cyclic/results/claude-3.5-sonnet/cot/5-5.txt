   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains multiple cycles formed by vertices. For example, there is a cycle formed by vertices 0-3-4-5-0, and another cycle through 1-2-3-0-1. The edges have directional arrows indicating directed connections between vertices, and the graph cannot be represented without edge crossings, confirming its cyclic nature rather than being planar or tree-like."
