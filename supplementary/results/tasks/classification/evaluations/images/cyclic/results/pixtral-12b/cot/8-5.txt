To classify the graph in the image, we will follow the outlined steps for analysis:

1. **Check for Cycles**:
   - The graph contains an edge between nodes 1 and 0.
   - Node 0 has edges connecting to nodes 2 and 5.
   - Node 2 has edges going to nodes 0 and 3.
   - Node 3 has edges to nodes 2 and 4.
   - Node 4 has an edge to node 5.
   - Finally, node 5 connects back to node 1, forming a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

Thus, the graph contains a cycle (1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 1).

2. **Check Connectivity Pattern**:
   - The graph does not have all vertices connected to all other vertices.
   - Although there is a cycle indicating connections among some vertices, others are less connected.
   - Vertices do not appear to form a hierarchical structure.

3. **Edge Crossings**:
   - The graph does not have any edge crossings.
   - The edges form a pattern without overlapping.

Given these observations, the graph does not align with being acyclic,ite, complete, mesh, or planar. The classification that fits best is **cyclic** due to the presence of at least one cycle.

Here is the final classification in JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle (1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 1) and does not have a hierarchical structure or all-pair connections."
}
```
