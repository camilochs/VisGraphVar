   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex). The vertices are not connected to all other vertices, and the graph does not form a hierarchical structure. The edges do not form a regular pattern or grid, and there are edge crossings, indicating that it is not a mesh or planar graph. Since it contains cycles, it is not a tree. Therefore, the best classification is cyclic."
