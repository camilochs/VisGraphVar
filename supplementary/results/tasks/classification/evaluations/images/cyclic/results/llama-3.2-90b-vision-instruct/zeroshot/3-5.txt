Based on the provided graph visualization, we can analyze its properties to determine its classification. The graph has 5 nodes and 7 edges, with all edges being undirected.

**Step 1: Check if the graph is Acyclic**
An acyclic graph is one that does not contain any cycles. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. In this graph, there are no cycles, so it is acyclic.

**Step 2: Check if the graph is Bipartite**
A bipartite graph is one where the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects two vertices from different sets. In this graph, the vertices cannot be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects two vertices from different sets, so it is not bipartite.

**Step 3: Check if the graph is Complete**
A complete graph is one where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In this graph, not every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so it is not complete.

**Step 4: Check if the graph is Cyclic**
As mentioned earlier, a cyclic graph is one that contains at least one cycle. Since this graph does not contain any cycles, it is not cyclic.

**Step 5: Check if the graph is Mesh**
A mesh graph is one where every vertex is connected to every other vertex, similar to a complete graph. In this graph, not every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so it is not a mesh.

**Step 6: Check if the graph is Planar**
A planar graph is one that can be drawn in a plane without any edge crossings. In this graph, all edges can be drawn without crossing each other, so it is planar.

**Step 7: Check if the graph is Tree**
A tree graph is a connected acyclic graph. Since this graph is acyclic and all nodes are connected, it is a tree.

Therefore, the final answer is:

```
{
   "type_graph": "tree",
   "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph."
}
```
