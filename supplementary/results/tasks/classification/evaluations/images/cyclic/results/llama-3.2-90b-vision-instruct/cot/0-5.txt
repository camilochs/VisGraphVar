**Step 1: Identify patterns and organization in the given graph.**

**Step 2: Determine the type of the graph based on the observation.**

**Step 3: Write a JSON format answer of the following category:**

```json
{
  "type_graph": "[answer]",
  "analysis": "Image displays the following type of graph: [answer]\n due to the following reasons: \n  : [reason] \n Please see flgure for a visual aid: \n[embed] image here [/embed]"
}
```



**Step 4: _pickle the function and display the result.**

According to Step 1, we can observe the following patterns and organization in the given graph:



With these patterns, we can determine that the graph is of type either Cyclie or acyclic



According to the definition of a graph: knowing there are no edge crossings we can determine that the graph is **Planar**.



Based on this observation, the solution to the question is in the following code format:



```json
{
  "type_graph": "Planar",
  "analysis": "Image displays a planar graph because there are no edge crossings.\decodedThreadPool ```
