Let me analyze this graph according to the given steps:

1. Cycle check:
- Following the directed edges, I can trace a cycle: 0 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0

2. Connectivity pattern:
- Not all vertices are connected to each other
- Vertices are not organized in distinct sets
- There's no clear hierarchical structure

3. Edge crossings:
- The graph can be drawn with minimal edge crossings
- Edges don't form a regular grid pattern

Based on these observations, here's the classification in JSON format:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle where vertices can be traversed in a loop following the directed edges (0→5→4→3→2→1→0), and the overall structure shows a directed cycle rather than a hierarchical or other specific pattern."
}
```
