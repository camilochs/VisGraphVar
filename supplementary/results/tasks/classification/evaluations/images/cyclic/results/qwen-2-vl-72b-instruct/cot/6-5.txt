   "type_graph": "acyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows an acyclic graph because there are no cycles (loops) in the graph. Each edge has a direction, and there is no path starting and ending at the same vertex. The connectivity pattern does not suggest any complete, bipartite, or hierarchical structure. The graph is not planar because it cannot be drawn without edge crossings, and it does not form a mesh or tree structure."
