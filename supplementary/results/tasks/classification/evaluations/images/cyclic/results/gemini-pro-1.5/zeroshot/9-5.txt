  "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic and planar graph. It is cyclic because there is a closed loop or cycle (0 -> 3 -> 5 -> 0, for instance).  It is planar because the graph can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. Although the current drawing has edges that appear to intersect, it can be redrawn without crossings."
