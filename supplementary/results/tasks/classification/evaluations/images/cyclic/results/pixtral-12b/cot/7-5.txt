Let's follow the steps to analyze the graph and categorize it:

1. **Check for cycles**:
   - We can start at vertex 3 and follow a path: 3 -> 5 -> 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 (which loops back to 2).

   **Conclusion**: The graph contains a cycle. 

2. **Examine the connectivity pattern**:
   - The vertices are not all connected to all other vertices (this would be a complete graph).
   - The vertices do form a hierarchical or redundant structure, where some vertices have multiple connections but not to every vertex directly (such as vertex 3).
   - The vertex sets are not distinctly partitioned in such a way that no two vertices within the same set are connected, which would define aite graph.

3. **Look at the edge crossings**:
   - The graph can be drawn without any edge crossings, indicating that it is a planar graph.

Based on this analysis:

- **Acyclic**: No, because it contains cycles (checked above).
- **Bipartite**: No, as there is no clear partition where no two vertices within the same set are connected.
- **Complete**: No, as not all vertices are connected to each other.
- **Cyclic**: Yes, it contains cycles.
- **Mesh**: Partially, but not entirely as it does not follow a grid pattern.
- **Planar**: Yes, the graph can be drawn without any edge crossings.
- **Tree**: No, it contains cycles which violates the definition of a tree.

**Final Classification**:

```json
{
   "type_graph": "Planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a Planar graph because it can be drawn without any edge crossings, indicating that it is planar."
}
