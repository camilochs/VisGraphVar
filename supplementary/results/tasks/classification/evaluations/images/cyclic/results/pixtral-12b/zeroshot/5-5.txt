To analyze the graph and classify it, we need to consider several properties such as the presence of cycles, connectivity, and completeness.

1. **Acyclic**: There are no cycles in the graph.
2. **Bipartite**: A graph isite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other. The provided graph does not fit this description well, as it contains a cycle.
3. **Complete**: Every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. Not all pairs of vertices in the provided graph are connected by edges.
4. **Cyclic**: The graph contains at least one cycle. Observing the graph, there indeed exists a cycle.
5. **Mesh**: A mesh graph typically has every pair of vertices connected. The provided graph doesn't satisfy this condition.
6. **Planar**: The graph can be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing. Given the complexity and number of edges, it's not straightforward to assert this visually without specific analysis tools.
7. **Tree**: A tree is acyclic and connected. The provided graph is neither acyclic nor does it conform to a tree structure.

Considering these properties, theclassification that best describes the provided graph is "cyclic":

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph."
}
