To classify the given graph, let's analyze it based on its characteristics:

1. **Acyclic**: An acyclic graph has no cycles. By inspecting the graph, we can determine if there are any loops or cycles.
2. **Bipartite**: A graph isite if its vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets.
3. **Complete**: A complete graph is one where every pair of vertices is connected by a unique edge.
4. **Cyclic**: A cyclic graph contains at least one cycle.
5. **Mesh**: A mesh (or hypercube) has vertices connected in a specific pattern, typically every vertex is connected to every vertex in adjacent layers.
6. **Planar**: A graph is planar if it can be embedded in the plane without edges crossing.
7. **Tree**: A tree is a connected acyclic graph.

Let's evaluate the graph in the image:

- The graph contains cycles (e.g., the vertices 0, 1, 4, and 5 form a cycle).
- The graph is notite as it contains odd cycles.
- The graph is not complete because not all vertices are connected to every other vertex.
- The concept of "mesh" does not fit well for this graph.
- The graph is not planar as it violates the planar graph conditions with certain crossings.
- The graph is not a tree as it contains cycles.

Based on the evaluation, the graph is cyclic.
