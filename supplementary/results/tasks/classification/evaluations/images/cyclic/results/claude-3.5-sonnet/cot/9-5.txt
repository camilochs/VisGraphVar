   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one cycle. Following the vertices, we can trace multiple paths that start and end at the same vertex (for example: 0->3->4->5->0). The graph has directed edges, is not fully connected, and while it has some edge crossings, these characteristics are secondary to the defining cyclic nature of the structure."
