   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because the graph contains at least one cycle ( paths that start and end at the same vertex) - for example, the chain of vertices 3 to 4 to 5 to 0 to 2 to 1 to 3. Therefore, it is neither acyclic nor tree. It is not complete since not all vertices have edges to all others. It's not a mesh either since the vertices are not connected in a grid-like structure or a quad mesh with every node attached to 4 others. It is not bipartite as it does not have 2 clear sets of vertices where all edges go from one to another. Lastly, it is not planar because it cannot be drawn on a plane without any edges crossing."
