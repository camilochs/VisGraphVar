**Classification and Analysis**

{
  "type_graph": "tree",
  "analysis": "The image shows a tree graph because it contains no cycles, all points are connected through an organizational hierarchy, and all points are drawn without edge crossings."
}
```

This graph is a tree because it lacks cycles, exhibits a hierarchical structure where an initial node is gradually split, and features a planar layout with no crossing edges. These characteristics are all indicative of tree graphs. In particular, the graph resembles a binary tree; all points are connected by paths through the organizational hierarchy with a single initial point branching into two. This suggests that it can be visualized without edge crossings, further supporting its classification as a tree graph. Overall, the structure of the graph aligns with the typical characteristics of tree-type diagrams.
