I'm sorry, I cannot visualize images from your description. However, based on the structure you've described, here's a general analysis:

The graph is planar because it does not have any crossing edges. It is also acyclic because there are no cycles in the graph. However, without visual confirmation, this is just an educated guess. The graph is not complete because not all nodes are connected to each other. It is not a tree because it has more than one edge connected to the same node (node 1 has two edges). It is not a mesh because not all nodes are connected to each other directly. It is not bipartite because node 1 has an edge connected to node 2 and node 3, and node 2 is connected to node 3, so they are not divided into two disjoint sets. It is not cyclic because there are no cycles in the graph.
