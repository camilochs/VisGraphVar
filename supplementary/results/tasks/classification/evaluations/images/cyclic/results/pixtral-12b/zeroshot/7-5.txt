To classify the given graph, let's analyze its properties:

1. **Acyclic**: The graph does not contain any cycles, meaning there is no path that starts and ends at the same node without retracing edges.
2. **Bipartite**: This classification requires that the graph's vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two graph nodes within the same set are adjacent. After inspecting the graph, it is not possible to divide the nodes into two such sets without having adjacent nodes within the same set.
3. **Complete**: Every node is connected to every other node. The provided graph is not complete, as there are gaps where some nodes are not directly connected.
4. **Cyclic**: The graph does not contain any cycles, eliminating this classification.
5. **Mesh**: This category involves fully connected nodes in a structured layout, which is not the case here.
6. **Planar**: This requires the graph to only intersect edges at their endpoints, which is not true for this graph.
7. **Tree**: A tree is a connected acyclic graph. The provided graph is connected and acyclic, hence it can be classified as a tree.

Given this analysis, the graph is classified as a tree.
