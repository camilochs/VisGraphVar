**Step 1: Check for cycles**

The graph contains a cycle between vertices 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, it is cyclic.

**Step 2: Examine connectivity pattern**

Not all vertices are connected to all other vertices. There are no distinct sets of vertices. The structure does not form a hierarchical structure.

**Step 3: Analyze edge crossings**

The graph can be drawn without edge crossings. There is no regular pattern or grid formed by the edges.

**Step 4: Determine the type of graph**

Based on the analysis, the graph is best classified as a planar graph because it can be drawn without edge crossings.

**Answer:**

```json
{
   "type_graph": "planar",
   "analysis": "The image shows a planar graph because it can be drawn without edge crossings."
}
```
