To analyze the graph in the image using the specified steps:

1. **Check for Cycles**:
   - By examining the vertices and edges, we can determine if there are any cycles in the graph. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, traveling through at least two other vertices.

2. **Examine Connectivity Pattern**:
   - **All vertices connected to all other vertices**: This is the property of a complete graph.
   - **Vertices organized in distinct sets**: This would be the property of a bipartite graph.
   - **Hierarchical structure**: This might indicate a tree-like structure.

3. **Look at Edge Crossings**:
   - **Can the graph be drawn without edge crossings**: This would indicate a planar graph.
   - **Regular grid**: Indicates a mesh or grid-like structure.

### Analysis of the given graph:
From the image, we can observe the following:
- **Cycles**: The graph appears to have cycles, for example, 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0 and 0 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 0.
- **Connectivity Pattern**: The vertices are not fully connected to each other, and there is a distinct path structure without specifying subsets.
- **Edge Crossings**: The graph cannot be drawn without edge crossings, indicating it is not planar.

### Final Classification:
Based on the observations above, the graph is categorized as **cyclic** due to the presence of cycles.

Below is the JSON formatted output as requested:

   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains cycles, indicating paths that start and end at the same vertex. Furthermore, the graph's vertices are not fully connected, and it is not possible to draw the graph without crossing edges, suggesting it is not planar."
