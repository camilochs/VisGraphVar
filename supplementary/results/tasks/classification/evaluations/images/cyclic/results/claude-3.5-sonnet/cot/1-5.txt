Let me analyze this graph step by step:

1. Checking for cycles:
- Following the arrows, we can see that there are cycles in the graph
- For example: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 forms a cycle

2. Examining connectivity:
- Not all vertices are connected to each other
- Vertices are not organized in distinct sets
- There isn't a clear hierarchical structure

3. Edge crossings:
- The graph has edges that cross
- The edges don't form a regular grid pattern
- The graph cannot be redrawn without edge crossings

4. Final classification:
This is clearly a cyclic graph due to the presence of directed cycles.

```json
{
   "type_graph": "cyclic",
   "analysis": "The image shows a cyclic graph because it contains at least one directed cycle where vertices can be traversed following the arrows and return to the starting point (e.g., 0->1->2->3->0). The graph has directed edges and multiple possible paths between vertices."
}
