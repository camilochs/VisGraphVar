I'd be happy to help you with that. However, I don't see a graph image provided. Please share the image, and I'll do my best to analyze it and provide the shortest path between nodes 1 and 5 in the expected JSON format.

Once I receive the image, I'll carefully examine the graph structure, identify the connections between nodes, and determine the shortest path using appropriate algorithms or techniques.

Please provide the graph image, and I'll get started on the analysis.
