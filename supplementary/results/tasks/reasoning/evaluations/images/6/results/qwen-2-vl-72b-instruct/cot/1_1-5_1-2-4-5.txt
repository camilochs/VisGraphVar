   "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "0", "4", "2", "5"],
   "analysis": "Starting from node 1, the shortest path to node 5 was determined by analyzing all possible paths and their respective distances. The shortest path found is 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 with a total distance of 5. This path was chosen because it has the lowest cumulative weight compared to other paths from 1 to 5. Each step in the path was chosen by selecting the edge with the lowest weight at each node."
