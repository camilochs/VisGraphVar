   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is through nodes 0, 2, and 3. The path selection is based on the minimum sum of edge weights. The total weight of this path is 5 (1 to 0 = 2, 0 to 2 = 1, 2 to 3 = 1, 3 to 5 = 1). This path is shorter than any other combination of nodes between 1 and 5."
