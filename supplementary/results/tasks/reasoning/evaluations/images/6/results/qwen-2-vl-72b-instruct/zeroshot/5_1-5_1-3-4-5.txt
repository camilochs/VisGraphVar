To find the shortest path between nodes 1 and 5, we need to analyze the graph and consider the weights of the edges connecting these nodes. 

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. Start at node 1.
2. From node 1, we can go to node 2 with a weight of 5.
3. From node 2, we can go to node 4 with a weight of 5.
4. From node 4, we can go to node 5 with a weight of 7.

The path with the shortest total weight is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5, with a total weight of 5 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Here is the JSON format output:

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4", "5"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is through nodes 2 and 4. The weights of the edges are considered, and the shortest path is found by adding the weights: 1->2 (5), 2->4 (5), 4->5 (7). The total weight of the path is 17."
}
```
