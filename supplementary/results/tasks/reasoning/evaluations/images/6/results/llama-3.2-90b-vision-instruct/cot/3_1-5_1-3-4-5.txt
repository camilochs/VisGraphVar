To determine the shortest path in this graph, we need to analyze each potential path segment from node 1 to node 5.

The graph from node 1 to 5 has the following potential paths or segments from 1 to 5. 

The direct path is from 1 to 5:  The weight for this path is 10. However, there is also another more extensive path from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5, which has a lower weight of 7 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12. This path is longer, so it can be eliminated.

Finally, the third potential path from from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5, which has a total weight of 7 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 18, is the longest path and, therefore, it can also be eliminated.

**The shortest path in this graph is from 1 to 5.**



**Final Answer**

The final answer is this JSON response:

```json
{
   "shortest_path": [ 1, 5],
   "analysis": "In this graph, the direct path from 1 to 5 has the lowest weighted value and is the shortest of all the potential paths between nodes 1 and 5."
}
```
