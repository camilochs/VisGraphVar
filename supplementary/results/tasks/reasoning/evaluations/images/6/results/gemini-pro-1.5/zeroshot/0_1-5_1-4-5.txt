```json
{
  "shortest_path": ["1", "4", "5"],
  "analysis": "From node 1, there are two paths to node 5: 1 -> 2 -> 5 (cost of 1 + 6 = 7) and 1 -> 4 -> 5 (cost of 6 + 1 = 7).  While we are asked for the shortest path and each of these is 7, for clarity and completeness, we output one route. Note that other longer paths also exist (e.g., through node 0)."
