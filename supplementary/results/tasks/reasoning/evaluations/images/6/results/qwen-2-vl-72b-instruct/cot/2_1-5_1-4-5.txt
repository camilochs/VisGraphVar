   "analysis": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5, we analyze the graph step by step. 

1. Start at node 1. The only direct path to node 5 is through the edge with weight 7. This path is clearly the shortest route from node 1 to node 5, as there are no other paths connecting these two nodes.

2. Evaluate potential longer paths: 
   - Starting at node 1, there is no path to node 5 through any other nodes, such as 0, 4, or 3, without looping or backtracking.

Since there are no alternative paths to node 5 available, the shortest path directly from node 1 to node 5 with a weight of 7 is the only path available. This path is the shortest because it is the only direct route and does not involve additional intermediate nodes or edges with higher weights."
