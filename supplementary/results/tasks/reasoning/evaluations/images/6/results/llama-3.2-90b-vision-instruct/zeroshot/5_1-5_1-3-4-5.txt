To determine the shortest path between nodes 1 and 5 in the given graph, without considering the arrow directions, we analyze all possible paths between these two nodes.

**Available Paths and Their Lengths**

Several paths exist from node 1 to node 5:

* **Path 1: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5**. With edges of weights approximately 6, 5, and 7, the total length of Path 1 is approximately 18.
* **Path 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5**. With edges of weights approximately 8, 1, and 7, the total length of Path 2 is approximately 16.
* **Path 3: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5**. With edges of weights approximately 6, 5, 1, and 3, the total length of Path 3 is approximately 15.
* **Path 4: 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5**. With edges of weights approximately 8, 5, and 7, the total length of Path 4 is approximately 20.

**Shortest Path and Analysis**

The shortest path between node 1 and node 5 is Path 3, which involves visiting nodes 1, 2, 4, 3, and 5 in that order. 

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1","2","4","3","5"],
   "analysis": "Path 3 was selected as the shortest path due to its calculated minimum distance of 15."
}
```

This simplified analysis focuses on the provided paths without additional considerations like negative cycles or more complex graph structures. Real-world applications may require more sophisticated algorithms and considerations.
