To identify the shortest path between the nodes labeled 1 and 5, we need to examine the connections and possibly account for weights if provided. However, the provided image does not show explicit weights on the edges, so we'll treat them as an unweighted graph.

Here is the analysis:

1. Start at Node 1.
2. Node 1 is directly connected to Node 5 with a path starting from Node 1.
3. Thus, the shortest path directly connects Node 1 and Node 5 with no intermediate nodes.

Given the described graph structure, here is the shortest path in JSON format:

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "5"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from Node 1 to Node 5 is a direct connection between Node 1 and Node 5, as there are no intermediate nodes involved."
}
```

This represents the simplest and most straightforward route in the context of an unweighted graph.
