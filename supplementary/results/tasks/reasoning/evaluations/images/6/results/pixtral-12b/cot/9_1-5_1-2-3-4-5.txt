To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5, we will analyze each potential path segment, considering both the length (number of edges) and the weights of the edges. Here's the process step-by-step:

1. **Node 1 to Node 5 via Node 4:**
   - Path: 1 -> 4 -> 5
   - Weights: 8 -> 7 
   - Total Weight: 8 + 7 = 15

2. **Node 1 to Node 5 via Node 3:**
   - Path: 1 -> 3 -> 5
   - Potential routes: 3 -> 5, 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
   - WEighs and check:
     - 1 -> 3: does not lead directly to 5 directly
     - Intermediate steps suggest 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
   - Weigh: 1->4: 8, 4->3: not direct, hence don't form a useful connection

3. **Outcome and conclusion**:
   - Comparing the paths, we see that the second path through intermediate points:
     - 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 has too many intermediate steps.
     where the first path 1 -> 4-> 5 is much more direct.

Thus, the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 in terms of steps and weights is:
- Path: 1 -> 4 -> 5

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "4", "5"],
   "analysis": "Upon examining all potential paths, the direct path 1 -> 4 -> 5 was found to be the shortest, with a total weight of 15. Intermediate steps such as via 3 alongside 4 led to either non-direct or longer paths."
}
