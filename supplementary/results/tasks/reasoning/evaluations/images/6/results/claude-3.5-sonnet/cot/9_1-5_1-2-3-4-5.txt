    "analysis": "After analyzing the directed graph, I evaluated several possible paths from node 1 to node 4:
    1. Path 1→4 directly: weight 10
    2. Path 1→2→4: weight 7 + 6 = 13
    3. Path 1→2→3→4: weight 7 + 3 + 1.9 = 11.9
    
    The shortest path is 1→4 with a weight of 10. This direct path proves to be more efficient than going through intermediate nodes, even though there appear to be multiple alternative routes. While the path through nodes 2 and 3 might seem promising due to some smaller individual edge weights, the cumulative weight ends up being larger than the direct path. The graph's structure shows several triangular formations, but the direct edge between nodes 1 and 4 provides the most efficient route."
