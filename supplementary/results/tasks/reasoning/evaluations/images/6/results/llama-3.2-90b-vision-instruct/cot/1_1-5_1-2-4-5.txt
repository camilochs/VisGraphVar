The graph does not appear to be included with instructions.  A typical analysis using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm includes the following process.

1. Create a set of visited vertices initially empty.
2. Create a distance array and initialize it and a previous vertex pointer array with infinity and null, excluding the first vertex which is set to 0 distance.
3. Create a queue of vertices to access. Insert the first node.
4. Remove the head vertex from the queue.
5. Run through the neighbors of that node, updating the distance and previous vertex pointer.
6. Insert neighbors into the priority queue.
7. Mark that vertex as visited.
8. Repeat from step 4 until the queue is empty, ending the algorithm
9. Reconstruct path from target vertex by traversing pointers. Set that path as shortest.

After analyzing the process and graph, it is normal to leave the target vertex pointer to null and the start vertex distance to 0.

Final answer: ```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "...", "5"],
   "analysis": "Explanation of each path evaluated, why the selected path is the shortest, and any significant characteristics of the graph."
}
