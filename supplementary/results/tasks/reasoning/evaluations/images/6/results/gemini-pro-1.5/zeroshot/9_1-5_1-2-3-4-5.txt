  "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is through node 4.  The path 1 -> 4 has a cost of 10, and the path 4 -> 5 has a cost of 5 + 7 = 12 in either direction. Therefore, the total cost of the path 1 -> 4 -> 5 is 10 + 7 = 17, which is confirmed by 8 + 3 = 11 + 6 from 1 -> 2-> 5 is 22 and the same 1 -> 2-> 5 is 1+6 also = 17. However 1 -> 2 -> 5 is 1+6=11 in terms of paths taken, but 17 as edge values.  The other possible path, 1 -> 2 -> 5, has a total cost of 1+6 =7 or 1+6  in terms of number of paths or edge values equal to 1+6 =7 or the same path the other way around costs only 7 as well."
