   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is through node 3. The path 1 -> 3 has a weight of 1, and 3 -> 5 has a weight of 10. This makes the total path weight 11. Other possible paths, such as 1 -> 2 -> 5 (weight 16) or involving node 4, have higher weights. Thus, the selected path is optimal in terms of the minimal total weight."
