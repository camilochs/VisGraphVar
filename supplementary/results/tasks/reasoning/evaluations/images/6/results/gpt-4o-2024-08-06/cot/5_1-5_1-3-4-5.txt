Path 1 -> 0: Weight = 8, costly to reach other nodes. Discarded.\n2. Path 1 -> 2: Weight = 6, leads to node 4 (1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5, total weight = 6 + 5 + 1 = 12).\n3. Path 1 -> 3: Weight = 1, promising due to low weight.\n - Path 1 -> 3 -> 2 leads to higher cumulative weight (5 more), and path to 5 involves additional nodes.\n - Path 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, total weight = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.\n4. Path 1 -> 4: Weight = 5, leads directly to 5 but overall weight is higher than through node 3 (5 + 1 = 6).\n\nThe path 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 is the shortest with a cumulative weight of 6. This graph demonstrates the efficiency of investigating low-weight segments and combining them for optimal paths."
