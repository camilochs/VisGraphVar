The weights are 1 (from 4 to 2) + 9 (from 2 to 5), totaling 10, making it longer than the direct path.\n3. **1 -> 4 -> 5:** This path involves moving to node 4 first. The weight from 1 to 4 is 6 and the weight from 4 to 5 is 1, summing to 7, which is longer than the direct path from 1 to 5.\n4. **1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5:** This path is even longer, going through nodes 0 and then 4. The weights sum up to 5 (1 to 0) + 5 (0 to 4) + 1 (4 to 5) = 11\n5. **1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 5:**.Weights are 5 + 9 + 9 = 23\n6. **1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5:** Weights are 5 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is the direct path 1 -> 5 with a weight of 6."
