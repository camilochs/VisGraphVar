   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4", "5"],
   "analysis": "Starting from node 1, we first examine the direct path to node 2. The shortest path to node 2 is 1 -> 2 with a weight of 6. From node 2, we can go to nodes 4 and 5. The path 2 -> 4 has a weight of 5, which is the shortest to node 4. From node 4, the shortest path to node 5 is 4 -> 5 with a weight of 7. Therefore, the overall shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 with a total weight of 18 (6 + 5 + 7)."
