Based on the given graph image, we can use a pathfinding algorithm such as Dijkstra's or breadth-first search to find the shortest path between nodes 1 and 5.

**Shortest Path Calculation:**

*   Node 1 has two neighbors, inherently weighted 1 and 4.
    *   Analyze possible paths or neighbors of the nodes:
        *   Nodes 1 → 4 is weighted at 10, while 1 → 1 is unweighted.
        *   Node 1 has no path other than along its weighted or unweighted connections.
    *   Continue path analysis for neighbor nodes with the smallest weight: Node 1 → 1.
        *   Continue evaluating: node 1 (unweighted) → 2. At node 2, 3 whispers are the lowest weighted path at a cost of 3. Continue along the subordinate weighted connections: 2 (weighted 3) → 3.
        *   An alternate path of lesser size via 3 indicates 3 to 5 is of size 3, and the path will be 1 (unweighted in given) → 2 → 3 → 5 for a total weighted path of 6. Path analysis complete.

*   Final Answer with Brief Explanation:\
    Based on the graph structure and weights, the shortest path looks to be between 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 with its lowest weighted path between the 1 and 5 nodes available.
