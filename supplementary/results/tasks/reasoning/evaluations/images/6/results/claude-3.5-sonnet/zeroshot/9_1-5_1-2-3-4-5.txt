    "analysis": "Looking at the weighted directed graph, the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is achieved by first going from node 1 to node 2 (with weight 1), then from node 2 to node 5 (with weight 3), giving a total path length of 4. While there are other possible routes through node 4 or combining other edges, they all result in larger total weights. For example, going through node 4 would involve weights of 10 plus 1.9, which is significantly longer than the chosen path of total weight 4."
