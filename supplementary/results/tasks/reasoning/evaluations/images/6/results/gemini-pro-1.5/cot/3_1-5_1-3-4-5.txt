  "analysis": "Starting at node 1, we need to find the shortest path to node 5. Here's the breakdown of possible paths and why the chosen path is the shortest:\n\n1. **Path 1 -> 4 -> 5:** This path has a total weight of 1 (1->4) + 1 (4->5) = 2. It involves two edges.\n\n2. **Path 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5:** This path has a weight of 3 (1->3) + 7 (3->4) + 1 (4->5) = 11 and involves three edges, making it longer than the direct path 1->4->5. This path can be immediately disregarded as suboptimal after discovering the weight from node 1 -> 3\n\n3. **Path 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5:** This path is even longer with edges 1->0, 0->3, 3->4, and 4->5, extending the previous suboptimal path and accumulating greater weights, making it less efficient. This path can immediately be discarded.\n\n4. **Path 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5:** Similar to paths 2 and 3, this adds an additional edge compared to path 2, extending an already longer route and again increases the total weight further.  This can also immediatley be discarded.\n\n5. **Path 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5:** Combining the least efficient aspects of every path previously considered, this path goes through every other node in the shortest theoretical path and would not even be considered a path to be taken since better options exist. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is 1 -> 4 -> 5 with a total weight of 2."
