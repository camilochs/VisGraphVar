To determine the shortest path, we follow these steps:

*   **Identify the starting and ending points**: The starting point is 1, and the ending point is 5.
*   **List possible paths**: Explore the paths from point 1 to point 5 by examining the edges connecting the vertices. The vertices are represented with flag shaped icons, and the edges are labeled with weights.

    The node 1 can connect to node 4 in one step with weight 10. Node 4 can then connect to node 3 in one step with weight 7. Node 3 can then connect to node 5 in one step with weight 3.
*   **Calculate the total weight of each path**: 10 + 7 + 3 = 20

    The same node 1 can connect to node 3 in one step with weight 6. Node 3 can connect to node 5 in one step with weight 7.
*   Total weight: 6 + 7 = 13
*   Now the original node 1 can connect directly to node 5 in one step with weight 8
*   If the indirect paths through nodes 4 and 3 are discarded in favor of the direct path from node 1 to node 5, analyzing weights 6 and 8, and identifying the lowest direct path, we will proceed to the next step.
*   **Discard unnecessary paths**: If the direct path is selected as the shortest, the indirect paths may be discarded in this simple calculation. However, take a step back and view all short paths considered. From this analysis, any indirect or longer paths are not as favorable as the shortest.

    Each step emphasizes the brewing process for beer, as each numbers step is a detail in the process and the hops used. Therefore, the path through node 2 should also be considered. Node 1 and node 2 are connected by a single edge with weight 6, although node 2 isn't a required part of the shortest path solution.

**Conclusion**

After carefully evaluating all possible paths and their respective weights, we conclude that the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is **1-5**, yielding a brief but simple synopsis of the steps and processes used to determine the shortest path.

**Shortest Path Response**

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "5"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path was found by carefully evaluating each node's potential paths and eliminating any that had more nodes or higher weights. Each possible path from the start node to the node end was individually searched to determine the quickest. The weight of 3 and 6 and 10 were all examined. Ultimately, the direct edge with weight 8 gave us the shortest topographic path without unnecessary steps. Keeping in mind that hop processing in particular requires attention to detail and traditional processes, this shortened approach would be the best and the fastest. Thus, the globally shortest path is '1-5,7'. The examination of local global paths and solutions resulted in an understanding of each decision step easily in the '1-5, 8' path."
