Let's analyze the given graph step by step to find the shortest path from node "1" to node "5".

### Graph Analysis

1. **Node 1**:
   - Direct connection to Node 2 with weight 1.
   - Direct connection to Node 0 with weight 7.

2. **Node 2**:
   - Connection to Nodes 3 and 4 with weight 2.
   - Connection to Node 0 with weight 4.

3. **Node 3**:
   - Connection to Node 5 with weight 5.
   - Connection to Nodes 2 and 4 with weight 2.

4. **Node 4**:
   - Connection to Nodes 2 and 3 with weight 2.
   - Connection to Nodes 0 and 5 with weight 10.

5. **Node 0**:
   - Connection to Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 with various weights.

6. **Node 5**:
   - Connection to Nodes 0 and 3 with weight 5 and 10, respectively.

### Paths to Consider:
1. Path 1: 1 -> 0 -> 5
2. Path 2: 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 5
3. Path 3: 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5
4. Path 4: 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
5. Path 5: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5
6. Path 6: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5

### Weight Calculations:

1. **Path 1**: 
   - 1 -> 0: 7
   - 0 -> 5: 5
   - Total: 7 + 5 = 12

2. **Path 2**:
   - 1 -> 2: 1
   - 2 -> 0: 4
   - 0 -> 5: 5
   - Total: 1 + 4 + 5 = 10

3. **Path 3**:
   - 1 -> 0: 7
   - 0 -> 4: 10
   - 4 -> 5: 1
   - Total: 7 + 10 + 1 = 18

4. **Path 4**:
   - 1 -> 0: 7
   - 0 -> 4: 10
   - 4 -> 3: 2
   - 3 -> 5: 5
   - Total: 7 + 10 + 2 + 5 = 24

5. **Path 5**:
   - 1 -> 2: 1
   - 2 -> 3: 2
   - 3 -> 5: 5
   - Total: 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

6. **Path 6**:
   - 1 -> 2: 1
   - 2 -> 4: 2
   - 4 -> 5: 5
   - Total: 1 + 2 + 5 = 8

### Conclusion:
The shortest path between nodes 1 and 5 has the lowest total weight of 8.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "3", "5"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from Node 1 to Node 5 was evaluated through several paths. Paths were examined by calculating their total weights. The paths considered were: 1 -> 0 -> 5, 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 5, 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5, 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5, and 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5. The shortest path with the least weight of 8 is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5."
