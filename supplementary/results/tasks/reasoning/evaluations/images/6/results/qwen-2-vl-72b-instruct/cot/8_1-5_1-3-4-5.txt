Here are the potential paths and their weights:\n\n1. 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 5: 7 + 4 + 3 = 14\n2. 1 -> 0 -> 5: 7 + 7 = 14\n3. 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5: 7 + 2 + 9 = 18\n\nThe shortest path is 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 5 with a total weight of 14. This path was chosen because it has the minimum total weight among all possible paths from node 1 to node 5. The other paths were either longer or had higher weights, so they were discarded."
