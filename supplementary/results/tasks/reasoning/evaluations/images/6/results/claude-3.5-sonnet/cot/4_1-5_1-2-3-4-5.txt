Let me analyze the possible paths from node 1 to node 5 and provide the shortest path in the requested format.

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "5"],
   "analysis": "I evaluated several possible paths from node 1 to node 5:\n1. 1 → 0 → 5 (total weight: 8 + 6 = 14)\n2. 1 → 2 → 5 (total weight: ∞)\n3. 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (total weight: ∞)\n4. 1 → 0 → 4 → 5 (total weight: 8 + ∞ + 5 = ∞)\n\nThe path 1 → 0 → 5 is the shortest with a total weight of 14. This path is optimal because:\n- It uses the fewest number of edges (2 edges)\n- It avoids the infinite weight edges\n- All other possible paths either include infinite weights or result in longer total distances"
