To analyze the graph and find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5, let's list and evaluate each potential path segment. 

1. Start at node 1, examine the paths toward node 5:
- Path 1: 1 -> 3. Weight of 8. This path is longer than the targeted path. Discard.
- Path 2: 1 -> 0. No path leading from 0 to 5 or any intermediary node leading to 5. Discard.
- Path 3: 1 -> 2 -> 4. Weight of 6. A potential path.
- Path 4: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 has an anticipated weight of 13. Discard because of higher weight.

2. For Path 3, assess and discard those less direct or longer paths:
- Direct path from 2 to 5 is not created, anticipating worse weighted paths. Opt to use 2 -> 0 -> 3, weight of 4, despite indirect travel.

3. Path 5: (1 -> 2 -> 0) -> 3 -> 5 has a total weight of 12 (6+4+2). Compare to weight of the inverse trip: 
- Inverse: 5 -> 3 -> 0, weight of 4, -> 0 -> 2 = weight of 4, and 2->1 = 6. No benefit in using inverse path.

Initial findings after completing analysis reveal the shortest path is (1 -> 2 -> 0) -> 3 -> 5 with a total weight of 12.
**Answer**
```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "0", "3", "5"],
   "analysis": "Starting from node 1, we identified multiple paths toward node 5. Path 1 and Path 2 were discarded due to direct higher weight and lack of connectivity, respectively. Path 3 shows potential upon further analysis, breaking down into multiple possible combinations. Comparing weights and paths, checking direct 2->5 travel is not provided. Opting for seeking out connections to nodes with existing directions toward node 5 results in utilizing the combination (1 -> 2 -> 0) -> 3 -> 5. This chosen direct trip of (1 -> 2 -> 0) -> 3 -> 5 was evaluated against the inverse trip, from the potential longer paths, and found to be the shortest or preferred route."
