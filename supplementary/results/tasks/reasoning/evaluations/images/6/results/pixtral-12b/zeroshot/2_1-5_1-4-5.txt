To determine the shortest path between the nodes labeled 1 and 5, we need to analyze the given graph. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Identify Direct Connections**: 
   - Node 5 is directly connected to node 1 (weight 3).
   - Node 1 is also connected to node 4 (weight 8), node 4 to node 0 (weight 4), and node 0 to node 4 again (weight 2).
   - Nodes 1 and 5 have other connections, but we are only interested in the connections directly relevant to our path.

2. **Evaluate All Possible Paths**:
   - Direct Path: 1 to 5 (weight 3)
   - Via Other Nodes:
     - No other nodes directly connect to both 1 and 5.

3. **Compare Path Weights**:
   - The direct path from node 1 to node 5 has a total weight of 3.

Given the straightforward connections and minimal branching, it is clear that the shortest path between node 1 and node 5 is the direct connection itself with a weight of 3.
