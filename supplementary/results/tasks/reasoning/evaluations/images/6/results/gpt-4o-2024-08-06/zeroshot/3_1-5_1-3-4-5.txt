   "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "4", "5"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is through nodes 3 and 4. The path is 1 -> 3 (weight 1), 3 -> 4 (weight 1), and 4 -> 5 (weight 1), resulting in a total weight of 3. This is the shortest path due to the visible weights on other connections being higher or leading to longer routes."
