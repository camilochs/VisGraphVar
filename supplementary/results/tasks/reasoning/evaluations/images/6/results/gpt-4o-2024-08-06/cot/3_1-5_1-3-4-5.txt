   "analysis": "Starting at node 1, we have several options. The direct path from 1 to 0 is of weight 10, and from 1 to 3 is of weight 3. Choosing 1 to 3 as it’s a lower weight. From node 3, we can go to 2 with weight 3 or 4 with weight 7. Another option from node 3 is directly to 4 with weight 1. We choose 3 to 4 because it’s lightest. At node 4, the direct path to 5 is of weight 1, which is optimal. Evaluating all paths, the path 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 has the total weight of 5, making it the shortest and most direct path."
