    "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4", "3", "5"],
    "analysis": "I evaluated several possible paths from node 1 to node 5:

    Path 1: 1 -> 5 (direct path with weight 7)
    Path 2: 1 -> 0 -> 5 (combined weight 11)
    Path 3: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 (combined weight 6)
    
    The path 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 is optimal because:
    - Starting from 1 to 2 costs 1
    - 2 to 4 costs 2
    - 4 to 3 costs 2
    - Final segment 3 to 5 costs 1
    - Total path weight = 6

    While there are more direct routes available, they have higher weights. The direct path from 1 to 5 costs 7, and other paths through node 0 are even longer. The chosen path, despite having more segments, provides the lowest total weight by utilizing the efficient connections through nodes 2, 4, and 3."
