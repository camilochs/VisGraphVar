   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4", "5"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path between nodes 1 and 5 is found by evaluating the weights of the edges. Starting from node 1, the direct path via node 2 to 4, and then to 5, accumulates to a total weight of 1 (from 1 to 2) + 5 (from 2 to 4) + 1 (from 4 to 5) = 7. This is the lowest cumulative weight compared to other possible paths. The graph structure shows multiple connections, but this path remains the most efficient given the edge weights."
