   "analysis": "Starting from node 1, the shortest path to node 5 can be determined by evaluating the total weight of each possible path. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 has a total weight of 4 (1 -> 2 = 4, 2 -> 3 = 0, 3 -> 4 = 1, 4 -> 5 = 3). Other paths include 1 -> 4 -> 5 with a weight of 5 (1 -> 4 = 2, 4 -> 5 = 3) and 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 with a weight of 5 (1 -> 3 = 4, 3 -> 4 = 1, 4 -> 5 = 3). Among these, the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 has the lowest total weight, making it the shortest path from 1 to 5."
