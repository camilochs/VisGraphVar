   "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "5"],
   "analysis": "Starting from node 1, there are two potential paths to reach node 5: 1 -> 0 -> 5 and 1 -> 2 -> 5. The path 1 -> 0 -> 5 has a total weight of 8 + 5 = 13, and the path 1 -> 2 -> 5 has a total weight of 9 + 5 = 14. Since 13 is less than 14, the shortest path from 1 to 5 is 1 -> 0 -> 5. There are no other paths from 1 to 5 that were not analyzed."
