  "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "5"],
  "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is through node 0. The direct cost from 1 to 5 would require traversing in the opposite direction of the directed edges.  Following the directed edges, the path 1 -> 0 -> 5 has a total cost of 8 + 6 = 14. Although node 4 connects to both 2 and 5, and 2 connects to 5, that path would be longer: 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 = 8 + 8 + 9 = 25, and 1 ->0 -> 4 -> 5 = 8 + 8+ 5 = 21."
