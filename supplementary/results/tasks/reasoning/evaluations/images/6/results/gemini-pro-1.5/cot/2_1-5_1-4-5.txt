This is the shortest path.\n\n* **Path through nodes 0 and 8 (1 -> 0 -> 8 -> 5):** This path involves traversing more edges and thus is longer than the direct path.\n\n* **Path through nodes 2, 3, and 8 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 8 -> 5):** This path also involves traversing more edges and is longer than the direct path.\n\n* **Path through other nodes would be indirect**.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to 5 is the direct path 1 -> 5."
