  "analysis": "Starting at node 1, we evaluate all possible paths to node 5.  There are two potential paths:\n\n1. **1 -> 5 (weight 7):** This is a direct path with a weight of 7.\n2. **1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 5 (weight 7 + 4 + unknown):** This path goes through nodes 2 and 0. Even without the weight of the edge between 0 and 5, the cost has already reached 11 (7+4) making it longer than the direct path 1->5.\n\nSince paths through nodes 3 and 4 inevitably lead back towards node 0 or 2 increasing the cumulative path cost, these options do not constitute shorter routes than the direct path from 1 to 5.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is 1 -> 5 with a weight of 7."
