**Analysis of the Shortest Path**

To determine the shortest path between nodes 1 and 6, we will analyze the given graph image. The graph is weighted, with each edge labeled with its corresponding weight.

Upon examining the graph, we can identify several possible paths between nodes 1 and 6:

* Path 1: 1 → 2 → 6 (weight: 2 + 9 = 11)
* Path 2: 1 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 6 (weight: 5 + 4 + 5 + 9 = 23)
* Path 3: 1 → 5 → 6 (weight: 5 + 2 = 7)

Comparing the weights of these paths, we find that Path 3 is the shortest, with a total weight of 7.

**Conclusions**

Based on the analysis, the shortest path between nodes 1 and 6 is:

1 → 5 → 6

This path has a total weight of 7, making it the most efficient route between the two nodes.
