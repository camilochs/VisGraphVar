{
  "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "6"],
  "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is via node 2. The direct path from node 1 to node 2 has a weight of 8, and from node 2 to node 6, the weight is 6. Any alternative paths involve higher cumulative weights or additional node traversals, making this path the most efficient in terms of total weight."
