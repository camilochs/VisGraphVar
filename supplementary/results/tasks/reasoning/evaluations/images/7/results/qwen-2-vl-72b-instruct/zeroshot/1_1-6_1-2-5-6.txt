   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is through nodes 2, 3, and 0. The path follows the edges with the least cost. Starting from node 1, the path goes to node 2 with a cost of 2, then to node 3 with a cost of 9, then to node 0 with a cost of 0, and finally to node 6 with a cost of 2. The total cost of this path is 2 + 9 + 0 + 2 = 13."
