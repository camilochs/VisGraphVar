   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "3", "5", "6"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 can be determined by calculating the cumulative weights of potential paths. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 has a total weight of 18 (6 + 6 + 6 + 3), which is less than any alternative path from node 1 to node 6. Other paths, such as 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 6, result in higher cumulative weights, making them suboptimal."
