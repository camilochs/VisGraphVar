The provided image does not contain a graph image to enable analyzing and identifying the exact shortest path between nodes 1 and 6. However, I can provide you with a general approach to find the shortest path in a graph.

To find the shortest path between nodes 1 and 6, you can use a graph traversal algorithm such as BFS (Breadth-First Search) or Dijkstra's algorithm. Assuming the graph is represented as an adjacency list or matrix, you can start from node 1 and explore its neighbors. If a neighbor is not visited before, mark it as visited and update the distance to that node. Continue this process until you reach node 6 or exhaust all reachable nodes.

If you provide the actual graph image, I can assist you in analyzing it and identifying the exact shortest path between nodes 1 and 6.

**Note:** Without the actual graph image, I cannot determine the exact shortest path. Please provide the graph image for further analysis.

In this case, I am unable to provide you with the solution in the expected JSON format with the nodes along the path and a brief explanation.
