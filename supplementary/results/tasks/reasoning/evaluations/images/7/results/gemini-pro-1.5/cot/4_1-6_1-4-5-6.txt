Path 3 goes through an additional node 3 and has a significantly higher cost (40) and can be ruled out immediately. Lastly, path 4 is a variation of path 1 which results in a total cost of 30, which is not shorter than Path 2. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path is 1 -> 4 -> 0 -> 5 -> 6 with a total weight of 27."
