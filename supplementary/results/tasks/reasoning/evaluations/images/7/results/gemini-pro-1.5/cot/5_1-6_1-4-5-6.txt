  "analysis": "Starting at node 1, we want to find the shortest path to node 6. Here's the breakdown:\n\n* **Path 1:** 1 -> 3 -> 6 (Cost: 10 + 6 = 16)\nThis path goes directly from node 1 to node 3 and then to node 6. The edge between 3 and 6 has multiple parallel edges, we choose the one with weight 6 as thatâ€™s the shortest length.  Edge between 1 and 3 has three parallel edges (weights 10, 6 and 10), we choose edge weight 6. The total distance is 12 (6+6) to reach 6 from node 1.\n\n* **Path 2:** 1 -> 0 -> 6 (Cost: 4+3+5 =12)\nThis path involves going to node 0 from node 1 (multiple edges between 1 and 0, choosing edge 3 as its of least weight) but adds up more cost as the path will involve addition of edge between node 0 and node 6 and it is not optimal then Path 1.\n\n* **Path 3:** 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 6 (Cost: 8 + 9 + 5 = 22)\nThis path is longer than to path 1 and path 2 involves addition of additional path length for node 2.\n\n* **Path 4:** 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 (Cost: 8+ unknown + 6 = greater than 16 as unknown edge not present)\nThis path goes through node 5, but edge between 5 and 3 is not mentioned so this makes a longer path in any case. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path is 1 -> 3 -> 6 with a total cost of 12."
