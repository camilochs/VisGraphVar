   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "6"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is through node 2. Starting at node 1, the path follows the edge with weight 2 to node 2, and then from node 2 to node 6, which has a weight of 9. This results in a total weight of 11 for the path. Other paths, such as going through nodes 4 or 3, involve higher total weights."
