Sure, let's analyze the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 in the graph.

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "6"],
   "analysis": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6, we need to consider each possible path and its weight. 

   First, let's identify the direct edge between node 1 and node 6. Since no direct edge exists, we explore other paths.

   - Path 1: 1 -> 3 -> 6
     - Edge 1 -> 3 has a weight of 5.
     - Edge 3 -> 6 has a weight of 7.
     - Total weight: 5 + 7 = 12.

   - Path 2: 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6
     - Edge 1 -> 0 has a weight of 7.
     - Edge 0 -> 5 has a weight of 6.
     - Edge 5 -> 2 has a weight of 1.
     - Edge 2 -> 4 has a weight of 1.
     - Edge 4 -> 6 has a weight of 1.
     - Total weight: 7 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26.

   - Path 3: 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 7 -> 6
     - Edge 1 -> 3 has a weight of 5.
     - Edge 3 -> 0 has a weight of 9.
     - Edge 0 -> 7 has a weight of 2.
     - Edge 7 -> 6 has a weight of 1.
     - Total weight: 5 + 9 + 2 + 1 = 17.

   - Path 4: 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 8 -> 6
     - Edge 1 -> 3 has a weight of 5.
     - Edge 3 -> 0 has a weight of 9.
     - Edge 0 -> 8 has a weight of 1.
     - Edge 8 -> 6 has a weight of 11.
     - Total weight: 5 + 9 + 1 + 11 = 26.

   Upon evaluating all these paths, the shortest path is 1 -> 3 -> 6 with a total weight of 12. This path has fewer edges and a lesser total weight compared to the other candidate paths."
}
```

This JSON output depicts the shortest path from node 1 to node 6, details about each evaluated path, and the reason why the selected path is the optimal one.
