Let's analyze the graph to find the shortest path between the nodes labeled 1 and 6. The visible connections and nodes include the following:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.

Since we need to determine the shortest path between nodes 1 and 6:

1. From node 1, the immediate connection to node 2 seems direct.
2. Node 2 is directly connected to node 6.

Considering the connections, the shortest path between nodes 1 and 6 involves passing through node 2.

Thus, the shortest path without any intermediate steps involves moving from node 1 to node 2 to node 6.

Here is the detailed data in JSON format:

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "6"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path between nodes 1 and 6 involves moving from node 1 to node 2 and then to node 6. This path is the most direct and minimizes the number of intermediate steps."
}
```
