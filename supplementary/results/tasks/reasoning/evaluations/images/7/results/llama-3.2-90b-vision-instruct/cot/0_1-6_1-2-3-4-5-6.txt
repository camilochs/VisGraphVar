**Step 1: Identify the shortest path from node 1 of the graph.**

To find the shortest path in the graph, we will start at node 1 and evaluate each available path leading to node 6. Our goal is to discover a path length either shorter than the length of other paths or a path of identical length but fewer nodes.

**Step 2: Evaluate each path**

There are three potential routes from node 1 that eventually lead to node 6:

1. (1, 2, 6)
2. (1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
3. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

First, we will evaluate each path to determine the shortest path to node 6. Then, we will compare the paths and choose the shortest path.

**Step 3: Analyze the shortest path**

When examining each path from node 1, we need to determine the path with fewer nodes, lower weights, and examine for unnecessary detours. By analyzing each route, we can identify the path that has fewer nodes (shorter) or lower weights:

*   Path (1, 2, 6) has 23 total weight and 3 nodes.
*   Path (1, 3, 4, 5, 6) has 20 total weight and 6 nodes.
*   Path (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) has 28 total weight and 7 nodes.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis of routes from node 1 to node 6, the shortest path in the graph evaluated for **fewest nodes, shortest path length, and lowest weights**, chosen for optimal efficiency and route directness is from node 1 to node 2 and finally to node 6.



**Final Answer**

The final answer is:

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "6"],
   "analysis": "Path 1 to 2 to 6 is both the shortest by number of nodes and the second shortest path by weight; the shortest path by weight only is the path from 1 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 6. The path from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 6 is the longest by both measures."
