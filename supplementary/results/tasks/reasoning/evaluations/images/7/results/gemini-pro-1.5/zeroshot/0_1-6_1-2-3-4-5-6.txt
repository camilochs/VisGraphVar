  "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"],
  "analysis": "While a direct connection exists between nodes 1 and 2, and from 2 there is a path to 3, 4, and 5 which eventually connects to 6, the weights on these edges sum to a larger number (6 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 23). Alternatively, nodes 1, 2, and 6 are connected to node 0, and paths 1-0-2-3-4-5-6 and 1-0-6 are possible. The path 1-0-6 has weights 9 and then 16 adding to 25, making the path to 6 via intermediate nodes more optimal with a total cost of 23."
