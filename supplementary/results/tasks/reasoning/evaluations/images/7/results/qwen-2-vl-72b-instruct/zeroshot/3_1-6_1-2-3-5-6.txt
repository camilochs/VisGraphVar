{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "5", "6"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is through nodes 5 and 6. Starting at node 1, the path goes to node 5 with a weight of 8, and then from node 5 to node 6 with a weight of 3. This path is the shortest because it has the lowest total weight of 11 compared to the other possible paths. Notably, the direct path from node 1 to node 5 has a higher weight (10) than the indirect path via node 5, which makes the indirect path the shortest."
