**Step 1: Identify the Possible Paths**

From node **`1`**, there are two lines connecting to node **`2`** and node **`6`**. We have two choices here: 

a) Select the line leading directly to node **`6`** or 
b) Select the other directed line leading to node **`2`**.

**Step 2: Enumerate Possible Paths**

Here are the actual paths in the graph:

**Direct Path** (No Stopping Intermediates): 1:1-6; 1:6 (Total Dist: 6)
 
**Multi-Stop Path** (Direct Edges): 1:1-2; 2:2-3, 2:3-6 (Total Dist: 12)

**Step 3: Optimal Path**

Based on this analysis alone, the most optimal path is **1:1-6**, which has a total distance of **`6`**.

**Contextual Answer**: (No other alternatives given)

Here is the Step-by-Step Solution in the correct expected format as requested:

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "6"],
   "analysis": "The optimal path is 1:1-6 due to its shortest total distance value, decreasing the amount of stops and travel time significantly in this particular graph structure."
}
```
