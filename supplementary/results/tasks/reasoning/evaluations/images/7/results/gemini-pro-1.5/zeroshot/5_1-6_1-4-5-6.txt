  "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "6"],
  "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is found by traversing the single edge connecting node 3 to node 6, after reaching node 3 from node 1.  The direct path 1 -> 3 -> 6 has a total weight of 3 (1 to 3) + 8 (3 to 5) = 11, which is less than any other possible route.  There are multiple parallel edges between nodes 1 and 3, with weights 10, 6, and 10 respectively. We choose the edge with weight 3 as it contributes to the shortest overall path from 1 to 6."
