Path 1->3->0->2->5->6: Total weight = 5+3+10+8+3 = 29\n3. Path 1->0->2->5->6: Total weight = 5+10+8+3 = 26\n4. Path 1->3->2->5->6: Total weight = 5+3+8+3 = 19\n\nThe path 1->2->5->6 is optimal because:\n- It has fewer intermediate nodes (only 2)\n- The total path weight of 17 is the lowest among all possible paths\n- It avoids longer cycles through nodes 0 and 3\n- The direct connection from node 5 to 6 with weight 3 is utilized\n\nThe graph shows multiple possible routes but the selected path minimizes both the number of hops and total edge weights."
