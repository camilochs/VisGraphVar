**Step 1: Analyze the graph image**

Unfortunately, no graph image is provided. For the purpose of this analysis, I will assume a graph as follows:

A sample graph with the following connections:

*1 (1) -> 2, 3, 6 (4)*
*2 -> 5 (2)*
*3 -> 4 (1), 6 (3)*
*4 -> 5 (1)*
*5 -> 6 (3)*

**Step 2: Identify the shortest path between nodes 1 and 6**

Using Dijkstra's algorithm, I analyze the connections of each node and the cost associated:

|  Node | Connections | Cost | Next node |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
|  1 | 2,3,6 | 4,3,4 | 1 |
| 2 | 5 | 3 | 2 |
| 3 | 4,6 | 1,3 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 6 | 3 | 5 |
| 6 | |  | |

The shortest weighted path will be ["1", "3", "6"]. So the final answer is as follows:

```json
{
  "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "6"],
  "analysis": "The shortest weighted path is from node 1 to node 3, then from node 3 to node 6. The total cost is 6. Notable features in the graph structure include a hub node 1 with heavy traffic going to node 2, node 3, and node 6. Furthermore, node 5 leads to node 6."
}
