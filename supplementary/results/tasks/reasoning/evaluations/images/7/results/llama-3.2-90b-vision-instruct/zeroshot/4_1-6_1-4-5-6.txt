I apologize, but no image was provided. 

However, if you're referring to a graph with nodes 1 through 6 and known edge weights as follows:

Edge weights:
- 1-2: 5
- 1-3: 10
- 2-3: 2
- 2-4: 7
- 3-4: 6
- 4-5: 8
- 2-5: 9
- 5-6: 6
- 4-6: 10


To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 on this graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm with the provided edge lengths, as no visual graph was provided. However, please note that without an image of the graph itself, explicit connections could exist that are not accounted for below.


The steps of Dijkstra's algorithm are as follows:

1.  **Create a distance list and set all distances equal to infinity except for the start node**, which is set to 0.
2.  **Create a set of unvisited nodes**.
3.  **Create a shortest-path tree (list) which maintains the shortest known path**.
4.  Set the start node equal to the first node (1).
5.  **Search for the node in the list of unvisited nodes nearest to the starting node**.
6.  **Create a set of neighboring nodes for the nearest node**.
7.  Check each neighbor to see whether the path through the nearest node is shorter than what was previously known for the neighbor.
8.  If the path through the current nearest node is shorter, update the neighbor's distance.
9.  **Update the shortest known distance** of the neighboring nodes.
10. **Stop when all nodes have been visited**.


**Data and Results**


*   Start node: 1
*   Destination node: 6
*   Neighbors of 1: {2, 3}
*   Distances of edges out of 1: 5 (node 2), 10 (node 3)


*   Find the nearest node: 2
*   Update distances of nodes adjacent to 2: 1, 2, 3, and 5. Update the shortest-distance trees. The distance to neighbor 2 is not needed because it's closer from previous nodes than from node 3.
*   Mark 2 as visited.
*   Find the nearest node: 3
*   Update distances of nodes 4 and 5 adjacent to 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The shortest-distance trees are updated.
*   Mark 3 as visited.
*   Find the nearest node: 5
*   Update distances of node adjacent to 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Update the shortest known distance trees of each neighbor.
*   Mark 5 as visited.
*   Find the nearest node: 4
*   Update distances of nodes 6 and 5 adjacent to 4: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Update the shortest trees.
*   Mark 4 as visited.
*   The nearest node is 6
*   Mark 6 as visited.

    "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "5","6"],
    "analysis": "When no visual graph was provided, this path was found to be the shortest based on the edges and their weights. The total weight of this path is 20 and it uses edge-weights 5, 9, and 6."
