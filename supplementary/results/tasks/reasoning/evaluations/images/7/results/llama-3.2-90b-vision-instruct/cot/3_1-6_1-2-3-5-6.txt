A graph is a non-linear data structure. It is composed of two prime components: a finite set of ordered pairs called edges or arcs and a finite set of nodes or vertices or points or corners.

Step 1: Assess the Path from Vertex 1 to Vertex 6

Given that there are five distinct paths from 1 to 6 – (1, 6), (1, 2, 6), (1, 2, 5, 6), (1, 3, 5, 6), and (1, 3, 4, 5, 6) - with weights 25, 21, 24, 23, and 31, respectively, it becomes apparent that (1, 2, 6), with a weight of 21, is the shortest path from 1 to 6.

Step 2: Assessment of the Shortest Path

By analyzing the remaining four paths, we conclude that (1, 6), (1, 3, 5, 6), and (1, 3, 4, 5, 6) are not the shortest path from 1 to 6.

Since the shortest path is a direct path from 1 to 6, and the nodes in the shortest path are distinct from each other, no other path can be shorter. Likewise, the unvisited nodes that may have appeared throughout the graph are ignored because the shortest path has been found.

As a result, the chosen shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 6 will be 6 steps long. The shortest path is 1, 2, 6, the sum of the weights of its edges is 21. It is the shortest path because its sum of weights for its edges is shorter than the remaining ones: 
25, 24, 23, and 31. Likewise, the nodes in the shortest path – 1, 2, and 6 are distinct from each other. This characteristic further confirms the shortest path.

The shortest path, (1, 2, 6), connects 1 to 6 with only two intermediate edges and is the shortest of all paths considered.

Answer:
```json
{
    "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "6"],
    "analysis": "Analyzed all existing paths between 1 and 6, the shortest path was chosen to be 1, 2, 6. Its sum of weights for its edges – 21 – is lower than the weight sums of its counterparts: 1, 6, (25), 1, 2, 5, 6, (24), 1, 3, 5, 6, (23), and 1, 3, 4, 5, (31). In other words, the path is shorter. No unvisited nodes were considered once the shortest path was found."
