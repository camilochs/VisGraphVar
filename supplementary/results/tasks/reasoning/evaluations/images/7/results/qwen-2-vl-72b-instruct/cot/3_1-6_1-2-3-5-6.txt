We then proceed from node 2 to node 6. The weight of this path is 13. \n3. Adding the weights of these two segments, we get a total path weight of 9 + 13 = 22. \n\nThere are no other shorter paths from node 1 to node 6 based on the given graph and its weights. \n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is [1, 2, 6] with a total weight of 22."
