Path 1 → 3 → 2 → 6: Total weight = 6 + 9 + 9 = 24\n3. Path 1 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 6: Total weight = 3 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 27\n4. Path 1 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 6: Total weight = 5 + 4 + 6 + 9 + 9 = 33\n\nThe path 1 → 2 → 6 is clearly the shortest with a total weight of 11. This direct route avoids the longer paths through nodes 3, 4, and 5 which would add unnecessary distance. The graph shows several alternative routes, but they all result in higher total weights due to additional edges and nodes traversed."
