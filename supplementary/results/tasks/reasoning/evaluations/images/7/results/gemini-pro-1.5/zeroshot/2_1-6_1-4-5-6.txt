  "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4", "6"],
  "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 involves traversing through nodes 2 and 4. The edge weights along this path (1, 1) sum to 2, which represents a shorter distance than any other path involving additional nodes or edges with higher weights like the path through 1 -> 0 adding up to 7 or 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 adding up to 14."
