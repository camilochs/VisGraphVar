   - Path 1->2->1: This path does not reach node 4 and is therefore not considered.\
   - Path 1->3: This is a direct path with a weight of 1.\
   - Path 1->2->3: This path has a total weight of 1 + 8 = 9, which is longer than the direct path 1->3.\
   - Path 1->2->0: This path has a total weight of 1 + 1 + 5 = 7, which is longer than the direct path 1->3.\
   - Path 1->3->4: This direct path has a weight of 1, which is the shortest path to reach node 4.\
   - Path 3->0->2: This path does not reach node 4 and is therefore not considered.\
   Therefore, the shortest path is 1->3->4 with a total weight of 1."
