To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4, let's evaluate each potential path step by step. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Path consideration:**
    - Direct path from node 1 to node 4: 
        - There is no direct edge from node 1 to node 4, and it is not connected directly. Therefore, we need to find alternative paths via intermediate nodes.

2. **Path via node 2:**
    - **Path: 1 → 2 → 4**
        - Weights (1 → 2): 2
        - Weights (2 → 4): 7
        - Total weight: 2 + 7 = 9
    - **Path: 1 → 2 → 0 → 4**
        - Weights (1 → 2): 2
        - Weights (2 → 0): 5
        - Weights (0 → 4): 7
        - Total weight: 2 + 5 + 7 = 14 
    - **Path: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4**
        - Weights (1 → 2): 2
        - Weights (2 → 3): 4
        - Weights (3 → 4): 7
        - Total weight: 2 + 4 + 7 = 13
  
3. **Path via node 3:**
    - **Path: 1 → 3 → 4**
        - Weights (1 → 3): Not directly connected.
        - Therefore, must include connections like other paths.

4. **Final path analysis:**
    - Given all the evaluated paths, the shortest path in terms of weighted sums is: 
        - **Path: 1 → 2 → 4**
        - Total weight: 9

{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4"],
   "analysis": "Evaluated all possible paths from node 1 to node 4 considering a direct approach and via intermediate nodes (2, 3). 
   Determined the shortest Path (1 → 2 → 4) with a total weight of 9. Paths through other nodes (1 → 2 → 0 → 4, 1 → 2 → 3 → 4) had higher total weights."
