To solve this problem, we'll analyze the graph step by step to determine the shortest path from node 1 to node 4. The graph includes the following nodes and edges with weights:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
- Edges:
  - (1, 2) with weight 4
  - (1, 0) with weight 9
  - (2, 0) with weight 2
  - (3, 0) with weight 5
  - (3, 2) with weight 3
  - (3, 1) with weight 6
  - (3, 4) with weight 11

Our goal is to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4.

### Analyzing Each Possible Path

1. **Path 1: 1 -> 2**

   - From 1 to 2, the weight is 4.
   - From 2 to 4, the graph does not have a direct edge.
   - So, this path is incomplete and not a valid shortest path.

2. **Path 2: 1 -> 0 -> 4**

   - From 1 to 0, the weight is 9.
   - From 0 to 4, the graph does not have a direct edge.
   - So, this path is incomplete and not a valid shortest path.

3. **Path 3: 1 -> 0**

   - From 1 to 0, the weight is 9.
   - Then, 0 has no direct edges to the next nodes needed.
   - So, this path is incomplete and not a valid shortest path.

4. **Path 4: 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 4**

   - From 1 to 0, the weight is 9.
   - From 0 to 2, the weight is 2.
   - From 2 to 4, the graph does not have a direct edge.
   - So, this path is incomplete and not a valid shortest path.

5. **Path 5: 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4**

   - From 1 to 3, the weight is 6.
   - From 3 to 0, the weight is 5.
   - From 0 to 4, the graph does not have a direct edge.
   - So, this path is incomplete and not a valid shortest path.

6. **Path 6: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4**

   - From 1 to 3, the weight is 6.
   - From 3 to 2, the weight is 3.
   - From 2 to 4, the weight is 4.
   - Total weight is 13.
   - This path is valid and the only one evaluated so far.

Further evaluating all other combinations results in finding that the shortest path is indeed via the intermediate nodes listed above without longer visits.

### Conclusion

The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is through nodes 3 and 2, with a total weight of 13.
