To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 in the given graph, we will analyze each potential path step by step. Here is the analysis:

1. **Start at node 1:**
   - From node 1, we can directly reach node 0 with a weight of 8.

2. **From node 0:**
   - From node 0, we can:
     - Reach node 2 with a weight of 9.
     - Reach node 3 with a weight of 3.

3. **From node 2:**
   - From node 2, we can reach node 3 with a weight of 5.

4. **From node 3:**
   - From node 3, we can reach node 2 with a weight of 5.

5. **From node 4:**
   - Node 4 is the destination.

Now, let's evaluate the paths:

1. **Path 1-0-2-3-2-4:**
   - Total weight: 8 + 9 + 5 + 2 = 24

This is the only valid path from node 1 to node 4. There are no other direct routes or shortcuts that can be taken to reach node 4 with a lower weight.

Therefore, the shortest path is 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4.

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "2", "3", "2", "4"],
   "analysis": "Evaluated all available paths from node 1 to node 4. The path [1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 4] was the only valid path with a total weight of 24. No other paths were possible due to the graph's structure and the given weights."
}
```
