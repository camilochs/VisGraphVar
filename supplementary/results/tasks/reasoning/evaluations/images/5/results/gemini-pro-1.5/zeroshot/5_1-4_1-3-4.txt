  "shortest_path": ["1", "4"],
  "analysis": "The graph shows a direct edge between nodes 1 and 4 with a weight of 2. This is the shortest and only path between these two nodes requiring a single hop.  The edge from node 0 to 2, and the edges connecting nodes 2, 3, and 4, are related, but not relevant for the shortest 1-to-4 path.  Edges from Node 0 to 2 and from 2 to 1 have the same weight as the single edge from 1 to 4 but are not part of the selected shortest path."
