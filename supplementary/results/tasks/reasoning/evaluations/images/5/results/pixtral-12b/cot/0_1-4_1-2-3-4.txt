   "analysis": "To determine the shortest path from node 1 to node 4, we analyze the possible paths systematically: 

1. Path 1 -> 3 -> 4:
   - Length: 1 + 4 (unknown intermediate value)
   - Total weight: 5 

2. Path 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4:
   - Length: 1 + 4 + 5 (unknown intermediate value)
   - Total weight: 10

3. Path 1 -> 2 -> 4:
   - Length: 1 + 1 (unknown intermediate value)
   - Total weight: 2

Considering the path weights and total lengths, the path 1 -> 2 -> 4 has the total weight of 2, which is the shortest possible route from 1 to 4.

Therefore, the shortest path is 1 -> 2 -> 4."
