To determine the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 in the given graph, we'll analyze and compare the potential paths step-by-step, considering the weights of the edges.

Let's begin by identifying the nodes and the edges with their weights:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4
- Edges with weights:
  - (1, 2) with weight 7
  - (1, 3) with weight 3
  - (2, 4) with weight 5
  - (3, 4) with weight 1
  - (0, 4) with weight 1
  - (1, 0) with weight 10

### Potential Paths from Node 1 to Node 4:
1. **1 -> 2 -> 4**
   - Weight: 7 (1 to 2) + 5 (2 to 4) = 12
2. **1 -> 3 -> 4**
   - Weight: 3 (1 to 3) + 1 (3 to 4) = 4
3. **1 -> 0 -> 4**
   - Weight: 10 (1 to 0) + 1 (0 to 4) = 11

### Shortest Path Analysis:
Upon evaluating the potential paths, we find:

- Path 1: 1 -> 2 -> 4, with a total weight of 12.
- Path 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4, with a total weight of 4.
- Path 3: 1 -> 0 -> 4, with a total weight of 11.

The path **1 -> 3 -> 4** is the shortest path with the least total weight of 4.

### Final JSON response:
```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "4"],
   "analysis": "Evaluated potential paths: 1) 1 -> 2 -> 4 (total weight = 12), 2) 1 -> 3 -> 4 (total weight = 4), 3) 1 -> 0 -> 4 (total weight = 11). The shortest path is 1 -> 3 -> 4 because it has the lowest weight of 4."
