Path 1 -> 3 -> 4:\n   - Cost: 7 (1 -> 3) + 5 (3 -> 4) = 12\n\n2. Path 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4: \n   - This path is not feasible because it would require travelling against the direction in 2 -> 0 \n\n3. Path 1 -> 0 -> 4:\n   - Cost: 10 (1 -> 0) + 5 (0 -> 4) = 10 + 5 = 15\n\n4. Path 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4\n   - Cost: 7 + 7 + 5 = 19\n\n5. Path 1 -> 2 -> ... \n      Not a valid path since all outbound edges from node 2 do not lead towards node 4\n\nComparing all feasible paths (1->3->4 and 1->0->4), the shortest path is 1 -> 3 -> 4, with a total cost of 12. Notice that since 0 -> 4 is unavoidable so we want minimze the cost to reach 0.  If we try 1-2-0, it costs 7+1=8 to reach 0, and then 5 to reach 4, totaling 13.  If we compare that to 1->3->4 of cost 12, 12 < 13, so 1->3->4 is the best path currently.  Consider also going directly via 1->0, the cost is 10+5=15, still greater than 12 via 1->3->4.  Thus, 1->3->4 should be the shortest path.  One more path to consider is 1-3-0-4 = 7+7+5 = 19, this path is longer than 1-3-4 or 1-0-4."
