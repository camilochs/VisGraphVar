  "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4"],
  "analysis": "The graph appears to be a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 involves traversing through node 2. The edges are weighted; the weight between nodes 1 and 2 is 1, 2 and 1 is also 1, and between 2 and 4 is 10. Following this, the total cost for the path from 1 to 4 passing through 2 is 1 (1->2) + 10 (2->4) = 11.  The cost from 1 to 4 through 0 would be 1 (1->0) + path from 0 to 4, which given the lack of that edge will be undefined and thus assumed to be infinite making the former path across node 2 shorter."
