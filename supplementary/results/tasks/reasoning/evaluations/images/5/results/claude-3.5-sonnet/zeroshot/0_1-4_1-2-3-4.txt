   "analysis": "Looking at the weighted directed graph, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is through node 3. The path follows the edge from node 1 to node 3 (weight 7), and then from node 3 to node 4 (weight 5), for a total path length of 12. While there are other possible paths through nodes 2 and 0, they either have higher total weights or don't provide a complete path to node 4. The graph shows a clear structure where node 3 serves as a crucial intermediate point for reaching node 4 from node 1."
