Path 1->0->4: Total weight = 8 + 5 = 13\n3. Path 1->2->3->4: Total weight = 6 + 8 + 7 = 21\n4. Path 1->0->3->4: Total weight = 8 + 9 + 7 = 24\n\nThe shortest path is 1->0->4 with a total weight of 13. This path is optimal because:\n- It requires fewer edges than paths going through node 3\n- The combined weight (13) is less than the alternative direct path through node 2 (16)\n- The path avoids the higher weights associated with paths involving node 3\n\nThe graph shows clear multiple path options, but the path through node 0 provides the most efficient route in terms of total weight."
