   "analysis": "First, we examine the direct paths from node 1. Starting with 1 -> 3 -> 4, the path has a weight of 2 (1 to 3) + 7 (3 to 4) = 9. Next, the path 1 -> 2 -> 4 involves weights of 9 (1 to 2) + 7 (2 to 4) = 16. We also consider the paths passing through more nodes, such as 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 2 -> 4, but these increase the total weight further. The path 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 involves weights 2 (1 to 3) + 4 (2 to 3) + 7 (2 to 4) = 13, which is shorter than many of the alternatives. Hence, we identify 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 as the shortest path with a total weight of 13."
