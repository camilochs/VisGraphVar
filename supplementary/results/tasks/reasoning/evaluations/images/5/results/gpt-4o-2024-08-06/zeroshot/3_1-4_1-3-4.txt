   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 involves moving from node 1 to node 3 with a weight of 2, and then from node 3 directly to node 4 with a weight of 7. The total weight of this path is 9, which is the least compared to other possible paths such as 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 with a higher cumulative weight."
