   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is determined by the visible connections and weights in the graph. Starting from node 1, the path continues to node 2 with the weight of 4, then from node 2 to node 0 with the weight of 20, and finally from node 0 to node 4 with the weight of 0. The cumulative weight of this path is 24, which is the shortest among the available paths from node 1 to node 4. The path directly from node 1 to node 4 is not shown and thus not considered."
