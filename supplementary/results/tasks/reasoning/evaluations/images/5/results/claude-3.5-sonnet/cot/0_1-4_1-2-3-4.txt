Let me analyze this directed graph and find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4.

```json
{
    "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "4"],
    "analysis": "I evaluated the following possible paths from node 1 to node 4:\n\n1. Path 1→3→4: Total weight = 7 + 6 = 13\n2. Path 1→2→0→3→4: Much longer path with multiple segments\n3. Path 1→0→3→4: Also a longer path with multiple segments\n\nThe path 1→3→4 is clearly the shortest because:\n- It has the fewest number of nodes (only 3)\n- It uses a direct connection that exists in the graph\n- Alternative paths require more intermediate nodes and result in higher total weights\n- While there are multiple ways to reach node 4, the direct path through node 3 minimizes the total distance traveled"
}
