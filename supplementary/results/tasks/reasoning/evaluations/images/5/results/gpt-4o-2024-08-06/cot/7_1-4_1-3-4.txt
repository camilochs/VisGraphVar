   "analysis": "Starting from node 1, we evaluate all potential paths to node 4. The path 1 -> 3 -> 4 involves the edges with weights 6 and 1, summing up to a weight of 7. Other possible paths include:\n\n1) Path 1 -> 2 -> 0 with a cost of 9 + undefined to 4. This path does not reach node 4 directly, and results in higher costs.\n2) Path 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0, again does not reach node 4 and results in a higher total cost because node 3 to 2 is 1, and from node 2 to node 4 is undefined.\n\nAfter discarding non-optimal paths, the direct connection via node 3 proves to be the shortest and most direct, at a total weight of 7, making it the optimal choice."
