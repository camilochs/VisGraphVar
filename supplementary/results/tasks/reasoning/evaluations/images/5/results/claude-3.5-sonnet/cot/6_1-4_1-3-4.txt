Path 1→3→2→3→4: Creates a cycle and would be longer\n\nThe shortest path is 1→3→4 with a total weight of 16 because:\n- It has fewer edges (only 2 segments)\n- Avoids any cycles in the graph\n- Has a lower total weight than other possible paths\n- Direct path through node 3 is more efficient than going through node 2\n\nThe graph shows a directed network with positive weights, and while there are multiple possible paths, the direct route through node 3 provides the optimal solution."
