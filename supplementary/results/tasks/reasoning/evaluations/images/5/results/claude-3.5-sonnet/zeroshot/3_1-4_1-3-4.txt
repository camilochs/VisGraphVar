I don't see a node labeled "4" in this graph. The graph appears to show nodes labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3 with weighted edges connecting them. The edges have weights marked in red numbers. Without being able to locate node 4, I cannot determine the shortest path between nodes 1 and 4.

To provide accurate assistance, please confirm if:
1. You meant different node numbers, or
2. The image might be incomplete, or
3. There might be a different graph you intended to share

Once you clarify, I'll be happy to analyze the shortest path between the correct nodes and provide the response in the requested JSON format.
