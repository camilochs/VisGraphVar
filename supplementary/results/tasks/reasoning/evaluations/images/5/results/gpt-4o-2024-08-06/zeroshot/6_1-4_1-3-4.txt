{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "3", "0", "4"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is through nodes 2, 3, and 0 to 4. This path has a total weight of 4 (1 to 2) + 10 (2 to 3) + 3 (3 to 0) + 10 (0 to 4) = 27. The structure of the graph allows for multiple routes, but this path has the lowest cumulative weight compared to other possible paths such as 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4, which totals 29."
