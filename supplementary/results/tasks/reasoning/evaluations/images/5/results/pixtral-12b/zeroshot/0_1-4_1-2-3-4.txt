To determine the shortest path between nodes labeled 1 and 4 in the given graph, we need to analyze the edges and their respective weights.

Here's the graph structure presented in the image:

- Nodes: \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}
- Edges with weights (in red):
  - Edge 1: (0 -> 1) with weight 1
  - Edge 2: (0 -> 3) with weight 6
  - Edge 3: (1 -> 2) with weight 7
  - Edge 4: (1 -> 3) with weight 1
  - Edge 5: (2 -> 0) with weight 1
  - Edge 6: (3 -> 4) with weight 5
  - Edge 7: (3 -> 1) with weight 7

### Shortest Path Analysis:
1. Starting from node 1:
   - Node 1 has direct edges to nodes 2 and 3.
   - Path from node 1 to node 3: (1 -> 3) with weight 1.
   - From node 3, there's another edge to node 4: (3 -> 4) with weight 5.

Summing the weights of these edges:
- Total weight of the path (1 -> 3 -> 4): 1 + 5 = 6

Considering other possible paths:
- Path (1 -> 3 -> 4):
  - (1 -> 3) with weight 1
  - (3 -> 4) with weight 5
- There is no other combination of paths providing a lower total weight.

### Conclusion:
The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 with the minimum total weight is confirmed to be:

- Path: [1 -> 3 -> 4]

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "4"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is found through nodes 3 to 4. This path accumulates the total weight of 6, which is the minimum total weight among all possible paths."
}
