{
  "shortest_path": ["1", "4"],
  "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is direct via an edge labeled with weight 1. This edge is the only direct path between 1 and 4, and it also has the smallest possible weight compared to other available paths. Other routes like 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 and 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4 have longer weights, making the direct path 1 -> 4 the optimal choice."
