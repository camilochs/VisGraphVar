Here is the analysis of the shortest path between nodes 1 and 4 in the given graph:

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "4"],
   "analysis": "To determine the shortest path between nodes 1 and 4, we need to evaluate the available paths based on the given edges. The graph shows the following connections: 1 is directly connected to 4 with an edge labeled 2. Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is straightforward, consisting only of these two nodes, as there are no intermediary nodes required. The edge weight is 2, which indicates the directness of the connection."
}
```

The shortest path between nodes 1 and 4 involves only these two nodes directly, with the path weight being 2. Given the visible connections, there are no alternative paths with fewer steps or lower weights, making this the optimal route.
