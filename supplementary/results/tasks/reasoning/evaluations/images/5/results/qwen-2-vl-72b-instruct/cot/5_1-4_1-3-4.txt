   "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "2", "4"],
   "analysis": "From node 1, we can reach node 4 via multiple paths: 1 → 2 → 4, 1 → 3 → 2 → 4, 1 → 3 → 4, and directly 1 → 4 with weights 3, 9, 8, and 4, respectively. The direct path 1 → 4 is the shortest path with a weight of 4, as it bypasses intermediate nodes and reaches the destination with fewer steps and a lower weight of 4 compared to the other options which have weights of 3, 9, and 8."
