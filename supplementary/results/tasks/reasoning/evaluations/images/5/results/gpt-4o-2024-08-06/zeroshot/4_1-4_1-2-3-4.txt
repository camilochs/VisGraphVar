   "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "2", "3", "4"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 involves going through nodes 0, 2, and 3. The path follows these connections with weights of 4 (1 to 0), 7 (0 to 2), 10 (2 to 3), and 10 (3 to 4). Despite multiple connections between nodes, this sequence offers the least combined weight of 31."
