Path through node 0: 1 -> 0 -> 4, total weight > 2\n3. Alternative paths through other nodes would require more segments and higher total weights\n\nThe direct path from node 1 to node 4 with weight 2 is clearly the shortest path, as it:\n- Has the minimum number of edges (just one)\n- Has the lowest total weight (2)\n- Avoids unnecessary intermediate nodes\n\nThe graph is relatively sparse with clear edge weights, making the shortest path identification straightforward in this case."
