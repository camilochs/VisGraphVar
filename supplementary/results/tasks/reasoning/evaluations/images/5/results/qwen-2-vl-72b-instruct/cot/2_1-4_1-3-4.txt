   "analysis": "Starting from node 1, we evaluate the paths to node 4. The direct path from 1 to 4 is not shown, so we look at indirect paths. The path from 1 to 0 to 4 is the only available indirect path. There are no other paths from 1 to 4, and this path includes the minimum number of nodes (3 nodes total) and has no explicitly shown weights that would suggest a longer route. Therefore, the shortest path from 1 to 4 is [1, 0, 4]."
