To find the shortest path between nodes 1 and 4, we can analyze the given graph by tracing the paths and considering the weights on the edges.

Here is the graph analysis:

- Node 1 is connected to node 0 with a weight of 4.
- Node 0 is connected to node 2 with a weight of 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 4 with a weight of 10.

So, the path from node 1 to node 4 via nodes 0 and 2 has a total weight of 4 + 8 + 10 = 22.

Therefore, the shortest path between nodes 1 and 4 is through nodes 0 and 2.

Here is the output in JSON format:

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "2", "4"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 goes through nodes 0 and 2, with a total weight of 22."
}
```
