Path 1 → 0 → 4: The total weight is 8 (3 from 1 to 0 and 5 from 0 to 4).\n   - This path is the shortest because it has a total weight of 8.\n\n2. Path 1 → 2 → 4: The total weight is 16 (6 from 1 to 2 and 10 from 2 to 4).\n   - This path is longer than the first path.\n\n3. Path 1 → 0 → 3 → 4: The total weight is 18 (3 from 1 to 0, 8 from 0 to 3, and 7 from 3 to 4).\n   - This path is also longer than 1 → 0 → 4.\n\nGiven all evaluated paths, 1 → 0 → 4 is selected as the shortest path, characterized by having the minimum total weight and fewer nodes, making it the most direct option toward node 4."
