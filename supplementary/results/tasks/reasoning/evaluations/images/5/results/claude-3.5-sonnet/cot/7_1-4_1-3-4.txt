This path is optimal because:\n- It has the fewest edges (only two segments)\n- The alternative paths through node 2 or node 0 involve more segments and larger weights\n- The direct connection from node 1 to node 3 (weight 6) followed by node 3 to node 4 (weight 1) provides the most efficient route\n\nThe graph shows a clear structure where bypassing node 3 to reach node 4 is impossible, making it a crucial intermediate point in any path to the destination."
