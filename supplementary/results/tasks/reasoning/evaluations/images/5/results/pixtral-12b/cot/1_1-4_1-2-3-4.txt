To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 in the graph, we need to examine the potential paths and analyze their structures and weights.

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "3", "2", "4"],
   "analysis": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4, we analyzed the graph starting from node 1. 

   - Path 1: 1 → 0 → 3 → 4
     - This path employs nodes 1, 0, 3, and 4 with the sequence of weights: 8 (1-0), 3 (0-3), and 4 (3-4). The total weight is 15.
   
   - Path 2: 1 → 3 → 2 → 4
     - This path employs nodes 1, 3, 2, and 4 with the sequence of weights: 8 (1-3), 4 (3-2), and 5 (2-4). The total weight is 17.
   
   Based on the total weights, the path 1 → 0 → 3 → 2 → 4 has the lowest sum of weights, making it the shortest path from 1 to 4."

}
```

In this graph:

- The path 1 → 0 → 3 → 2 → 4 has the lowest total weight of 17, making it the shortest path.
- Weights:
  - 1 → 0: 8
  - 0 → 3: 3
  - 3 → 2: 4
  - 2 → 4: 5

This analysis accounts for each step and ensures that the shortest path is chosen based on the cumulative weights of the nodes.
