**Step 1: Step-by-Step Analysis in JSON**

```json
{
    "shortest_path": "1 → 2 → 4",
    "analysis": "The shortest path is determined by selecting the edges with the lowest weights without forming a cycle. Edges (b, d) and (d, c) are not included in the path, as they would form a cycle. The path connects nodes 1 to 4 with the weights: 1-2=9, 2-4=7. For completeness, we include the other path obtained from nodes 1 to 4: 1 → 3 → 2 → 4, with the weights: 1-3=2, 3-2=6, 2-4=7. Comparing the weights, we find the shortest path 1 → 2 → 4 has a total weight of 16, while the alternative path 1 → 3 → 2 → 4 has a total weight of 15, making it the actual shortest path."
