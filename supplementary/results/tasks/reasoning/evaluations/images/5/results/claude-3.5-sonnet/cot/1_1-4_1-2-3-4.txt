    "analysis": "After analyzing the graph, I found these possible paths from node 1 to node 4:\n\n1. Direct path 1 -> 4 (weight: 3)\n2. Path 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (weights: 8 + 6 + 10 + 2)\n3. Path 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (weights: 2 + 10 + 2)\n\nThe direct path 1 -> 4 with weight 3 is clearly the shortest option. Alternative paths involve multiple nodes and significantly higher cumulative weights (path 2 totals 26, path 3 totals 14). The graph's structure shows several longer alternative routes, but the direct connection between nodes 1 and 4 provides the most efficient path."
