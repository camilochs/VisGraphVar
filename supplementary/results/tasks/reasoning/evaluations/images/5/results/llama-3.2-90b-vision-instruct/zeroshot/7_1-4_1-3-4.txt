To determine the shortest path between the nodes labeled 1 and 4 in the given graph image, we can utilize Dijkstra's algorithm, a popular graph search algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

**Step 1: Understanding the Graph Structure**

The provided graph image shows the following nodes and connections:

*   Node 1 is connected to:
    *   Node 2 (unweighted)
    *   Node 3 (weighted, weight not specified)
*   Node 2 is connected to:
    *   Node 1 (unweighted)
    *   Node 4 (unweighted)
*   Node 3 is connected to:
    *   Node 1 (weighted, weight not specified)
*   Node 4 is connected to:
    *   Node 2 (unweighted)

**Step 2: Dijkstra's Algorithm Application**

To apply Dijkstra's algorithm and identify the shortest path from node 1 to node 4, we follow these steps:

1.  **Initialization**: Mark all nodes as unvisited and assign a distance value to each node, with the distance to the starting node (node 1) set to 0 and all other distances set to infinity.
2.  **Select Starting Node**: Choose node 1 as the starting node and mark it as visited.
3.  **Explore Neighbors**: Explore the neighbors of node 1, which are nodes 2 and 3.
4.  **Update Distances**: Update the distance values of nodes 2 and 3 based on the weights. Since the weights are not specified, we will assume the shortest distance is via node 2.
5.  **Select Next Node**: Choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance value, which is node 2.
6.  **Repeat Exploration and Updates**: Repeat steps 3-5 until node 4 is selected.
7.  **Construct Shortest Path**: Once node 4 is selected, construct the shortest path by tracing back the visited nodes from node 4 to node 1.

**Step 3: Calculating Distances**

Assuming the weights on the edges between nodes 1 and 3 are equal to 1:

*   Distance from node 1 to node 2: 1
*   Distance from node 2 to node 4: 1
*   Total distance along the path node 1 -> node 2 -> node 4: 2
