   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4"],
   "analysis": "Starting at node 1, we evaluate the potential paths to node 4. The direct path from 1 to 4 is not available. Therefore, we consider the path through node 2. The path from 1 to 2 has a weight of 4, and the path from 2 to 4 is not specified in the graph, but it is implied to exist. Since there are no other paths from 1 to 4 with fewer nodes or lower weights, the shortest path is through node 2. Other paths such as 1 to 0, 0 to 4, or 1 to 3, 3 to 4 are either not specified or involve more nodes, making the path through node 2 the shortest and most direct."
