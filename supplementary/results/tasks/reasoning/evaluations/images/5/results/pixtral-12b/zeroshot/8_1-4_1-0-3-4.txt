   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 in the graph is through node 2. The path selected is 1 -> 2 -> 4. The weight of the selected edges are considered: 1 and 2 share an edge with weight 6, and 2 and 4 share an edge with weight 5, making the total path weight 11. Other potential paths might have higher weights, making this specific path the shortest."
