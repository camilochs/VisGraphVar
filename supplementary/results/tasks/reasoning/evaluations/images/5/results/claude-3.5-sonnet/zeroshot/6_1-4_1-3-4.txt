   "analysis": "Looking at the directed weighted graph, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 goes through nodes 3 and 0. The path follows: 1→3→0→4. While there are multiple possible paths in the graph, this route minimizes the total distance based on the edge weights shown. The path takes advantage of the directed edges and provides the most efficient route to reach node 4 from node 1. Other potential paths exist through node 2, but they would result in a longer total distance."
