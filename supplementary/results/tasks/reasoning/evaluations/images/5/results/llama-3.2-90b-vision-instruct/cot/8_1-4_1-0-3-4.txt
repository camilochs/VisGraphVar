To determine the shortest path in the graph, we will follow each path segment toward 4 from the starting point 1. We will examine the number of nodes and weight of each path and discard those that are longer or less direct until only the shortest path remains. 

**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Graph**

* The graph has three paths from 1 to 4:
	* Path 1: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4: 5 + 6 + 8 + 4 = 23 and 5 edges
	* Path 2: 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 0 -> 4: 5 + 1 + 8 + 4 = 18 and 5 edges
	* Path 3: 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 10 -> 8 -> 4: 5 + 6 + 5 + 6 = 22 and 6 is the second node 
* **Path 1 vs. Path 2:** Path 2 is shorter than Path 1, so Path 1 is discarded. In the case of path 3, we compared it with Path 2 because both were only 1 path above it (in directivity) and Path 2 was shorter than Path 3. Thus, Path 3 is discarded.
* Therefore, Path 2 provides the shortest path from 1 to 4, which is **1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 0 -> 4: 5 + 1 + 8 + 4 = 18.** 

The analysis of each path segment determines the shortest path from 1 to 4, finds any indirect nodes, evaluates each path's node count, and compares total path weight from 1 to 4.

**Conclusion**

The shortest path from 1 to 4 in this graph is 1 -> **5 -> 7 -> 0 -> 4: 5 + (result below is given in the json format as as requested)**
