   "analysis": "I analyzed several possible paths from node 1 to node 4:\n1. Path 1->2->4: Total weight = 9 (2 + 7)\n2. Path 1->0->3->2->4: Total weight = 19 (9 + 4 + (-1) + 7)\n3. Path 1->3->2->4: Total weight = 12 (3 + (-1) + 7)\n\nThe path 1->2->4 is clearly the shortest with a total weight of 9. While there are multiple possible routes through nodes 0 and 3, these introduce additional edges and weights that increase the total path length. The direct path through node 2 minimizes both the number of edges traversed and the total weight accumulated."
