To identify the shortest path between the nodes labeled 1 and 4, we need to consider the visual connections and any weights provided in the graph. The graph does not show explicit weights, so we will consider the paths in terms of the number of connections (hops) between the nodes.

Here is the analysis in JSON format:

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "4"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is through node 0 with exactly two hops. This path is determined by considering the minimum number of connections or hops between the nodes, as there are no weights indicated to consider in the determination."
}
```
