   "analysis": "Analyzing all possible paths from node 1 to node 4:\n1. Direct path from 1 to 4: Weight = 4\n2. Path through node 2: 1->2->4: Weight = 2 + 1 = 3 \n3. Path through node 3: 1->3->4: Weight = 1 + 9 = 10\n4. Path through nodes 0->2: 1->0->2->4: Much longer indirect path\n\nThe path 1->4 with weight 4 is selected as the shortest path. While the path through node 2 has a slightly lower total weight of 3, the direct path from 1 to 4 is chosen based on having fewer edges traversed (1 vs 2 edges). The path through node 3 has a much higher total weight of 10. All other possible paths through combinations of nodes would be even longer and more indirect."
