  "analysis": "The path from node 1 to node 2 has a cost of 2, and the path from 2 to 4 has a cost of 3 + 3 = 6.  Additionally, the direct path from node 2 to 3 has a cost of 10.  The path from 1 to 0 has a weight of 8, and from 0 to 3, the cost is 6 +6 + 10=22. There is an indirect path from 1 to 4 via node 2, where the cost is 2 from 1 to 2 and then 2+3 = 5 from 2 and 4. Therefore, total cost is 2+6=7.  The direct path from 2 to 4 is 3 + 3 = 6, and from node 1 to node 2 is of cost 2. Therefore the total cost from 1 to 4 is 2+ 6 = 8. The other path from 1 to 4 cost 8 from 1 to 0, and 6 to 2 and 6 from 2 to 4. Making it total 20.  Therefore, the shortest path from 1 to 4 is 1 -> 2 -> 4 with a total cost of 2+6=8."
