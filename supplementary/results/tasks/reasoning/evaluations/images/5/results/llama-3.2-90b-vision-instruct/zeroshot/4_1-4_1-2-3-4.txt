**Step 1: Identify the nodes and their connections in the graph.**

The graph has five nodes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The connections between these nodes are as follows:

- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 3 is also connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3 and node 4.

**Step 2: Determine the weights of the connections.**

The weights of the connections are as follows:

- The connection from node 1 to node 3 has a weight of 1.
- The connection from node 3 to node 2 has a weight of 7.
- The connection from node 3 to node 4 has a weight of 4.
- The connection from node 2 to node 4 has a weight of 0.

**Step 3: Find the shortest path between nodes 1 and 4.**

To find the shortest path, we need to consider all possible paths from node 1 to node 4 and choose the one with the lowest total weight.

- Path 1: Node 1 -> Node 3 -> Node 4 (Weight: 1 + 4 = 5)
- Path 2: Node 1 -> Node 3 -> Node 2 -> Node 4 (Weight: 1 + 7 + 0 = 8)

**Step 4: Select the shortest path.**

Based on the weights calculated above, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is Path 1: Node 1 -> Node 3 -> Node 4 with a total weight of 5.

**Answer:** 

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "4"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is selected based on the minimum total weight of the connections traversed. In this case, moving directly from node 1 to node 3 and then to node 4 yields the lowest total weight compared to the alternative path that includes node 2."
}
