To find the shortest path between nodes 1 and 4 in the given graph, we need to analyze the possible routes and their associated weights.

Hereâ€™s the detailed analysis of the graph:
```json
{
    "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4"],
    "analysis": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4, we need to consider the weights of the connecting edges. 

    - The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is direct: 1 -> 4.
    - However, the edge between node 1 and node 4 has a weight of 7, which indicates it is not minimal in terms of weight.
    - Another feasible path is via node 2, where: 1 -> 2 -> 4.
    - The combined weight of this path is 1 (1 -> 2) + 2 (2 -> 4) = 3.
    - Weighing against other paths like via node 3 or any combinations provided does not form a route conserving a lower total.
    - Therefore, the route 1 -> 2 -> 4 with a total weight of 3 is offered as the path with the least accumulation."
}
```

This interpretation shows that despite the immediate edge from node 1 to node 4, passing through node 2 allows for a more efficient traversal in weight selection.
