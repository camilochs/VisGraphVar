   "analysis": "Looking at the weighted directed graph, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is through node 3. This path consists of two edges: from node 1 to node 3 (weight: 6) and from node 3 to node 4 (weight: 1), giving a total path weight of 7. Alternative paths through nodes 2 or 0 would result in longer total distances. The direct path through node 3 is optimal as it minimizes the sum of edge weights while requiring the fewest number of node transitions."
