**Step 1: Identify the shortest path between nodes 1 and 4.**

To find the shortest path, we need to analyze the connections and weights between the nodes.

**Step 2: Analyze the connections and weights.**

From node 1, there are two direct connections: one to node 2 with a weight of 2 and another to node 5 with a weight of 5. From node 5, there's a connection to node 4 with a weight of 7. Alternatively, from node 1, we can reach node 3 with a weight of 8, but this path does not lead directly to node 4.

**Step 3: Determine the shortest path based on the analysis.**

The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is through node 5, with a total weight of 12 (5 + 7).

**Step 4: Provide the shortest path in the required JSON format.**

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "5", "4"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is through node 5 with a total weight of 12. This path is selected because it minimizes the total weight among all possible paths between the two nodes."
}
```
