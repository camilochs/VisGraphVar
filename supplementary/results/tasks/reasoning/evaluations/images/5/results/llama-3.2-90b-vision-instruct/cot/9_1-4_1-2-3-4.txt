**Step 1: Identify all paths from 1 to 4**

There are two paths from 1 to 4 in the graph:

Path 1: 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4
Path 2: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

**Step 2: Evaluate each path based on the number of nodes and weights**

Path 1:

*   Number of nodes: 4 (including the starting and ending nodes)
*   Weights:
    *   Edge from 1 to 2: 2
    *   Edge from 2 to 0: 2
    *   Edge from 0 to 4: 3
*   Total weight: 7

Path 2:

*   Number of nodes: 4 (including the starting and ending nodes)
*   Weights:
    *   Edge from 1 to 2: 2
    *   Edge from 2 to 3: 3
    *   Edge from 3 to 4: 2
*   Total weight: 7

**Step 3: Select the shortest path**

Both paths have the same total weight of 7. However, Path 2 has a slightly longer total length due to the edge weight from node 2 to 3 being 3. Since the total weight is the same, the decision is based on the directness and the sum of the edge lengths in this scenario. Path 1 is chosen as it maintains a consistent weight per step along the path.

**Conclusion**

The shortest path from node 1 to 4, considering both the number of nodes and the weights, is Path 1.

**Answer**

```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "0", "4"],
   "analysis": "Both paths from 1 to 4 have equal numbers of nodes and weights but the shortest path chosen is the one with lower sums of the weights along the path. This graph can be described as an unweighted directed acyclic graph, also known as a DAG. All edges represent unidirectional relationships between nodes and no cycle occurs. Given that the weights are uniform, the shortest path ends up being the one that has the most consistent, lower values."
