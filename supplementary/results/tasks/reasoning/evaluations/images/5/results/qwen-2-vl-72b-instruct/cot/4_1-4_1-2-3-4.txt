   "shortest_path": ["1", "0", "2", "3", "4"],
   "analysis": "Starting from node 1, the shortest path to node 4 is by evaluating the minimum weight paths. From node 1, the path to node 0 has a weight of 4. From node 0, the shortest path to node 2 is directly, with a weight of 7. From node 2, the path to node 3 has a weight of 10. Finally, from node 3 to node 4, the path is direct with a weight of 10. This path (1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4) is the shortest because it has the lowest total weight among all possible paths from 1 to 4, with a total weight of 4 + 7 + 10 + 10 = 31. Other paths either have a higher total weight or are not direct."
