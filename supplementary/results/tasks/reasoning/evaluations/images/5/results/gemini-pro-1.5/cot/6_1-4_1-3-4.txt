  "analysis": "Starting from node 1, we want to find the shortest path to node 4. Here's the breakdown of possible paths and why we choose the shortest one:\n\n1. **Path 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4:**  This path has a total weight of 4 + 3 + 10 = 17.\n2. **Path 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 4:** This path has a total weight of 6 + 10 + 10 = 26. This path is longer than the Path 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4.\n3. **Path 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4:** This path is clearly longer than Path 2, as it introduces an additional edge and node (3 to 2) adding to the overall weight. No need to calculate, it's already suboptimal.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4, with a total weight of 17."
