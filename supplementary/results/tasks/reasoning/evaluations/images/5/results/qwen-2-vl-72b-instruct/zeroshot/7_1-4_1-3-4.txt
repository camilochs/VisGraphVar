   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 can be identified by examining the connections and weights. From node 1, the direct connection to node 3 has a weight of 6. From node 3, there is a direct connection to node 4 with a weight of 7. Therefore, the path from node 1 to node 3 to node 4 has a total weight of 6 + 7 = 13. This is the shortest path because it is the only path from node 1 to node 4 given the graph's structure."
