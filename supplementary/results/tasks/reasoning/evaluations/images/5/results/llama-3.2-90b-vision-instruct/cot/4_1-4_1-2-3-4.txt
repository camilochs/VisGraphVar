To find the shortest path in this graph, we will analyze the structure step by step. We will begin at node 1 and examine each potential path segment toward node 4, taking note of any paths with fewer nodes or lower weights.

**Step 1: Evaluate Direct Paths from Node 1**

There are no direct paths from node 1 to node 4.

**Step 2: Evaluate Paths with One Intermediate Node**

The paths with one intermediate node are:

* 1 -> 2 -> 4 (weight: 10 + 4 = 14)
* 1 -> 3 -> 4 (weight: 10 + 4 = 14)

Both paths have the same weight, so we will consider them further.

**Step 3: Evaluate Paths with Two Intermediate Nodes**

The paths with two intermediate nodes are:

* 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (weight: 10 + 2 + 4 = 16)
* 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 (weight: 10 + 7 + 4 = 21)

These paths have higher weights than the paths with one intermediate node, so we can discard them.

**Step 4: Select the Shortest Path**

Based on our analysis, the shortest paths are 1 -> 2 -> 4 and 1 -> 3 -> 4, both with a weight of 14. Since there are two equally short paths, we can select either one as the shortest path.

**Conclusion**

The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is 1 -> 2 -> 4 or 1 -> 3 -> 4, both with a weight of 14. We selected this path because it has the lowest weight among all possible paths.

**JSON Response**

```json
{
  "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "4"],
  "analysis": "We evaluated all possible paths from node 1 to node 4 and selected the path with the lowest weight. The selected path has a weight of 14 and passes through nodes 1, 2, and 4. We discarded paths with higher weights or more intermediate nodes. The graph has two equally short paths, and we selected one of them as the shortest path."
}
```

Alternatively, we could have selected the path 1 -> 3 -> 4 as the shortest path, which would result in the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "4"],
  "analysis": "We evaluated all possible paths from node 1 to node 4 and selected the path with the lowest weight. The selected path has a weight of 14 and passes through nodes 1, 3, and 4. We discarded paths with higher weights or more intermediate nodes. The graph has two equally short paths, and we selected one of them as the shortest path."
