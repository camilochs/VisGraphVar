  "analysis": "Starting at node 1, we want to find the shortest path to node 4. We have two possible paths:\n\n1. **Path 1: 1 -> 4:** This path has a weight of 2.\n2. **Path 2: 1 -> 2 -> 4:** This path has a total weight of 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nComparing the two paths, Path 1 (1 -> 4) with a weight of 2 is clearly shorter than Path 2 (1 -> 2 -> 4) with a weight of 6.  Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is 1 -> 4."
