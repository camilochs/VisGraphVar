   "analysis": "The graph contains both weighted and unweighted paths between nodes. To determine the shortest path between nodes 1 and 4, we assess all possible paths: 1 -> 0 -> 4 has a total weight of 5 (0 to 4), while 1 -> 2 -> 4 would have a significantly higher combined weight. Thus, the path through node 0 is optimal. The overall shortest path is 1 to 0 to 4 with a total weight of 11."
