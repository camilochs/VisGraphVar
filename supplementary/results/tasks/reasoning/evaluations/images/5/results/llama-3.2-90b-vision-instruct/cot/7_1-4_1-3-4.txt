The graph structure is as follows:

```
1 -> 3 (w=6)
1 -> 2 (w=9)
2 -> 1 (w=10)
2 -> 0 (w=5)
2 -> 3 (w=5)
2 -> 4 (w=6)
0 -> 3 (w=7)
0 -> 4 (w=1)
3 -> 1 (w=6)
3 -> 4 (w=1)
```

Analysis:
Begin by analyzing the paths connected to vertex 1, the starting vertex. Since the goal is to find the shortest path, it is essential to evaluate each path segment individually and compare their weights or node counts.

The direct path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 is not available, so we must examine paths involving intermediate vertices. Starting with vertex 1, we find that the path 1 -> 3 requires a weight of 6, and 1 -> 2 requires a weight of 9.

Next, we consider the paths starting at vertex 2. The path 2 -> 3 has a weight of 5, and 2 -> 4 has a weight of 6.

Moving to vertex 0, we find the path 0 -> 3 with a weight of 7 and a path 0 -> 4 with a weight of 1. 

After weighing the pros and cons of each path segment, the optimal path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 is as follows:

1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4

This path has the fewest edge weights among all available paths from vertex 1 to 4.

{
    "shortest_path": ["1", "2", "0", "4"],
    "analysis": "After evaluating each path from vertex 1 to 4, we chose path [1, 2, 0, 4] because it has the fewest edge weights. It satisfies that condition with a total weight of 5 + 1 = 6, with fewer nodes and a lower overall weight than all other paths, making it the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex 4."
