```json
{
   "shortest_path": ["1", "3", "4"],
   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is through node 3 with a total weight of 1 (from 1 to 3) + 9 (from 3 to 4) = 10. The direct path from 1 to 4 has a weight of 8, but going through node 3 yields a shorter path due to lower combined weights. The graph structure shows multiple navigation routes, but this combination provides the minimum cumulative weight."
