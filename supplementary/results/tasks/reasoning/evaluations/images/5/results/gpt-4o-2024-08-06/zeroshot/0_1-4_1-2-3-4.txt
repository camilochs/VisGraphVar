   "analysis": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 can be identified by analyzing the weights of available paths. Starting at node 1, the edge to node 2 has a weight of 1. From node 2, we proceed to node 0 with a weight of 1. Finally, from node 0 to node 4, the path has a weight of 5. This results in a total path weight of 7, which is the shortest among all available paths between these nodes."
