  "analysis": "Starting from node 1, we have two main paths to consider to reach node 4:\n\n1. **Path 1: 1 -> 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4:** This path involves traversing the edges with weights 8, 6, 10, and then 3. The total weight of this path is 8 + 6 + 10 + 3 = 27.\n\n2. **Path 2: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4:**  This path uses the edges with weights 2, 10, and then 3. The total weight is 2 + 10 + 3 = 15.\n\nThere is another seemingly direct edge from an intermediate point to the goal, node 4: 1 -> 4.  However, without a specified weight for the edge directly connecting nodes 1 and 4, this cannot be considered as the shortest path.\n\nComparing the two analyzed paths, Path 2 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4) has a total weight of 15, which is significantly less than Path 1 with a weight of 27. Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4."
