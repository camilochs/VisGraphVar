   "analysis": "Looking at the weighted directed graph, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 can be found by going from node 1 to node 3 (weight 5), and then from node 3 to node 4 (weight 2), for a total path length of 7. While there are other possible routes through node 0 or node 2, they would result in longer total path lengths. The path through node 3 provides the most direct and efficient route between nodes 1 and 4."
